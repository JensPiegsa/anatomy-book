Connections between the body and the CNS occur through the spinal cord.
The cranial nerves connect the head and neck directly to the brain, but
the spinal cord receives sensory input and sends motor commands out to
the body through the spinal nerves. Whereas the brain develops into a
complex series of nuclei and fiber tracts, the spinal cord remains
relatively simple in its configuration ([\[link\]](#fig-ch16_04_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). From the initial neural tube early in
embryonic development, the spinal cord retains a tube-like structure
with gray matter surrounding the small central canal and white matter on
the surface in three columns. The dorsal, or posterior, horns of the
gray matter are mainly devoted to sensory functions whereas the ventral,
or anterior, and lateral horns are associated with motor functions. In
the white matter, the dorsal column relays sensory information to the
brain, and the anterior column is almost exclusively relaying motor
commands to the ventral horn motor neurons. The lateral column, however,
conveys both sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and
brain.

# Sensory Modalities and Location

The general senses are distributed throughout the body, relying on
nervous tissue incorporated into various organs. Somatic senses are
incorporated mostly into the skin, muscles, or tendons, whereas the
visceral senses come from nervous tissue incorporated into the majority
of organs such as the heart or stomach. The somatic senses are those
that usually make up the conscious perception of the how the body
interacts with the environment. The visceral senses are most often below
the limit of conscious perception because they are involved in
homeostatic regulation through the autonomic nervous system.

The sensory exam tests the somatic senses, meaning those that are
consciously perceived. Testing of the senses begins with examining the
regions known as dermatomes that connect to the cortical region where
somatosensation is perceived in the postcentral gyrus. To test the
sensory fields, a simple stimulus of the light touch of the soft end of
a cotton-tipped applicator is applied at various locations on the skin.
The spinal nerves, which contain sensory fibers with dendritic endings
in the skin, connect with the skin in a topographically organized
manner, illustrated as dermatomes ([\[link\]](#fig-ch16_04_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). For example, the fibers of eighth cervical
nerve innervate the medial surface of the forearm and extend out to the
fingers. In addition to testing perception at different positions on the
skin, it is necessary to test sensory perception within the dermatome
from distal to proximal locations in the appendages, or lateral to
medial locations in the trunk. In testing the eighth cervical nerve, the
patient would be asked if the touch of the cotton to the fingers or the
medial forearm was perceptible, and whether there were any differences
in the sensations.

![Both panels in this image show the front view of a human body. The left image shows different regions in different colors. In both images, different parts are labeled.](../resources/1611_Dermatomes-02.jpg "The surface of the skin can be divided into topographic regions that relate to the location of sensory endings in the skin based on the spinal nerve that contains those fibers. (credit: modification of work by Mikael H&#xE4;ggstr&#xF6;m)"){: #fig-ch16_04_02 data-media-type="image/jpg" data-title="Dermatomes"}

Other modalities of somatosensation can be tested using a few simple
tools. The perception of pain can be tested using the broken end of the
cotton-tipped applicator. The perception of vibratory stimuli can be
testing using an oscillating tuning fork placed against prominent bone
features such as the distal head of the ulna on the medial aspect of the
elbow. When the tuning fork is still, the metal against the skin can be
perceived as a cold stimulus. Using the cotton tip of the applicator, or
even just a fingertip, the perception of tactile movement can be
assessed as the stimulus is drawn across the skin for approximately 2–3
cm. The patient would be asked in what direction the stimulus is moving.
All of these tests are repeated in distal and proximal locations and for
different dermatomes to assess the spatial specificity of perception.
The sense of position and motion, proprioception, is tested by moving
the fingers or toes and asking the patient if they sense the movement.
If the distal locations are not perceived, the test is repeated at
increasingly proximal joints.

The various stimuli used to test sensory input assess the function of
the major ascending tracts of the spinal cord. The dorsal column pathway
conveys fine touch, vibration, and proprioceptive information, whereas
the spinothalamic pathway primarily conveys pain and temperature.
Testing these stimuli provides information about whether these two major
ascending pathways are functioning properly. Within the spinal cord, the
two systems are segregated. The dorsal column information ascends
ipsilateral to the source of the stimulus and decussates in the medulla,
whereas the spinothalamic pathway decussates at the level of entry and
ascends contralaterally. The differing sensory stimuli are segregated in
the spinal cord so that the various subtests for these stimuli can
distinguish which ascending pathway may be damaged in certain
situations.

Whereas the basic sensory stimuli are assessed in the subtests directed
at each submodality of somatosensation, testing the ability to
discriminate sensations is important. Pairing the light touch and pain
subtests together makes it possible to compare the two submodalities at
the same time, and therefore the two major ascending tracts at the same
time. Mistaking painful stimuli for light touch, or vice versa, may
point to errors in ascending projections, such as in a <span
data-type="term">hemisection</span> of the spinal cord that might come
from a motor vehicle accident.

Another issue of sensory discrimination is not distinguishing between
different submodalities, but rather location. The two-point
discrimination subtest highlights the density of sensory endings, and
therefore receptive fields in the skin. The sensitivity to fine touch,
which can give indications of the texture and detailed shape of objects,
is highest in the fingertips. To assess the limit of this sensitivity,
two-point discrimination is measured by simultaneously touching the skin
in two locations, such as could be accomplished with a pair of forceps.
Specialized calipers for precisely measuring the distance between points
are also available. The patient is asked to indicate whether one or two
stimuli are present while keeping their eyes closed. The examiner will
switch between using the two points and a single point as the stimulus.
Failure to recognize two points may be an indication of a dorsal column
pathway deficit.

Similar to two-point discrimination, but assessing laterality of
perception, is double simultaneous stimulation. Two stimuli, such as the
cotton tips of two applicators, are touched to the same position on both
sides of the body. If one side is not perceived, this may indicate
damage to the contralateral posterior parietal lobe. Because there is
one of each pathway on either side of the spinal cord, they are not
likely to interact. If none of the other subtests suggest particular
deficits with the pathways, the deficit is likely to be in the cortex
where conscious perception is based. The mental status exam contains
subtests that assess other functions that are primarily localized to the
parietal cortex, such as stereognosis and graphesthesia.

A final subtest of sensory perception that concentrates on the sense of
proprioception is known as the <span data-type="term">Romberg
test</span>. The patient is asked to stand straight with feet together.
Once the patient has achieved their balance in that position, they are
asked to close their eyes. Without visual feedback that the body is in a
vertical orientation relative to the surrounding environment, the
patient must rely on the proprioceptive stimuli of joint and muscle
position, as well as information from the inner ear, to maintain
balance. This test can indicate deficits in dorsal column pathway
proprioception, as well as problems with proprioceptive projections to
the cerebellum through the <span data-type="term">spinocerebellar
tract</span>.

Watch this [video][1] to see a quick demonstration of two-point
discrimination. Touching a specialized caliper to the surface of the
skin will measure the distance between two points that are perceived as
distinct stimuli versus a single stimulus. The patient keeps their eyes
closed while the examiner switches between using both points of the
caliper or just one. The patient then must indicate whether one or two
stimuli are in contact with the skin. Why is the distance between the
caliper points closer on the fingertips as opposed to the palm of the
hand? And what do you think the distance would be on the arm, or the
shoulder?

# Muscle Strength and Voluntary Movement

The skeletomotor system is largely based on the simple, two-cell
projection from the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe to the skeletal
muscles. The corticospinal tract represents the neurons that send output
from the primary motor cortex. These fibers travel through the deep
white matter of the cerebrum, then through the midbrain and pons, into
the medulla where most of them decussate, and finally through the spinal
cord white matter in the lateral (crossed fibers) or anterior (uncrossed
fibers) columns. These fibers synapse on motor neurons in the ventral
horn. The ventral horn motor neurons then project to skeletal muscle and
cause contraction. These two cells are termed the upper motor neuron
(UMN) and the lower motor neuron (LMN). Voluntary movements require
these two cells to be active.

The motor exam tests the function of these neurons and the muscles they
control. First, the muscles are inspected and palpated for signs of
structural irregularities. Movement disorders may be the result of
changes to the muscle tissue, such as scarring, and these possibilities
need to be ruled out before testing function. Along with this
inspection, muscle tone is assessed by moving the muscles through a
passive range of motion. The arm is moved at the elbow and wrist, and
the leg is moved at the knee and ankle. Skeletal muscle should have a
resting tension representing a slight contraction of the fibers. The
lack of muscle tone, known as <span data-type="term">hypotonicity</span>
or <span data-type="term">flaccidity</span>, may indicate that the LMN
is not conducting action potentials that will keep a basal level of
acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction.

If muscle tone is present, muscle strength is tested by having the
patient contract muscles against resistance. The examiner will ask the
patient to lift the arm, for example, while the examiner is pushing down
on it. This is done for both limbs, including shrugging the shoulders.
Lateral differences in strength—being able to push against resistance
with the right arm but not the left—would indicate a deficit in one
corticospinal tract versus the other. An overall loss of strength,
without laterality, could indicate a global problem with the motor
system. Diseases that result in UMN lesions include cerebral palsy or
MS, or it may be the result of a stroke. A sign of UMN lesion is a
negative result in the subtest for <span data-type="term">pronator
drift</span>. The patient is asked to extend both arms in front of the
body with the palms facing up. While keeping the eyes closed, if the
patient unconsciously allows one or the other arm to slowly relax,
toward the pronated position, this could indicate a failure of the motor
system to maintain the supinated position.

# Reflexes

Reflexes combine the spinal sensory and motor components with a sensory
input that directly generates a motor response. The reflexes that are
tested in the neurological exam are classified into two groups. A <span
data-type="term">deep tendon reflex</span> is commonly known as a
stretch reflex, and is elicited by a strong tap to a tendon, such as in
the knee-jerk reflex. A <span data-type="term">superficial reflex</span>
is elicited through gentle stimulation of the skin and causes
contraction of the associated muscles.

For the arm, the common reflexes to test are of the biceps,
brachioradialis, triceps, and flexors for the digits. For the leg, the
knee-jerk reflex of the quadriceps is common, as is the ankle reflex for
the gastrocnemius and soleus. The tendon at the insertion for each of
these muscles is struck with a rubber mallet. The muscle is quickly
stretched, resulting in activation of the muscle spindle that sends a
signal into the spinal cord through the dorsal root. The fiber synapses
directly on the ventral horn motor neuron that activates the muscle,
causing contraction. The reflexes are physiologically useful for
stability. If a muscle is stretched, it reflexively contracts to return
the muscle to compensate for the change in length. In the context of the
neurological exam, reflexes indicate that the LMN is functioning
properly.

The most common superficial reflex in the neurological exam is the <span
data-type="term">plantar reflex</span> that tests for the <span
data-type="term">Babinski sign</span> on the basis of the extension or
flexion of the toes at the plantar surface of the foot. The plantar
reflex is commonly tested in newborn infants to establish the presence
of neuromuscular function. To elicit this reflex, an examiner brushes a
stimulus, usually the examiner’s fingertip, along the plantar surface of
the infant’s foot. An infant would present a positive Babinski sign,
meaning the foot dorsiflexes and the toes extend and splay out. As a
person learns to walk, the plantar reflex changes to cause curling of
the toes and a moderate plantar flexion. If superficial stimulation of
the sole of the foot caused extension of the foot, keeping one’s balance
would be harder. The descending input of the corticospinal tract
modifies the response of the plantar reflex, meaning that a negative
Babinski sign is the expected response in testing the reflex. Other
superficial reflexes are not commonly tested, though a series of
abdominal reflexes can target function in the lower thoracic spinal
segments.

Watch this [video][2] to see how to test reflexes in the abdomen.
Testing reflexes of the trunk is not commonly performed in the
neurological exam, but if findings suggest a problem with the thoracic
segments of the spinal cord, a series of superficial reflexes of the
abdomen can localize function to those segments. If contraction is not
observed when the skin lateral to the umbilicus (belly button) is
stimulated, what level of the spinal cord may be damaged?

# Comparison of Upper and Lower Motor Neuron Damage

Many of the tests of motor function can indicate differences that will
address whether damage to the motor system is in the upper or lower
motor neurons. Signs that suggest a UMN lesion include muscle weakness,
strong deep tendon reflexes, decreased control of movement or slowness,
pronator drift, a positive Babinski sign, <span
data-type="term">spasticity</span>, and the <span
data-type="term">clasp-knife response</span>. Spasticity is an excess
contraction in resistance to stretch. It can result in <span
data-type="term">hyperflexia</span>, which is when joints are overly
flexed. The clasp-knife response occurs when the patient initially
resists movement, but then releases, and the joint will quickly flex
like a pocket knife closing.

A lesion on the LMN would result in paralysis, or at least partial loss
of voluntary muscle control, which is known as <span
data-type="term">paresis</span>. The paralysis observed in LMN diseases
is referred to as <span data-type="term">flaccid paralysis</span>,
referring to a complete or partial loss of muscle tone, in contrast to
the loss of control in UMN lesions in which tone is retained and
spasticity is exhibited. Other signs of an LMN lesion are <span
data-type="term">fibrillation</span>, <span
data-type="term">fasciculation</span>, and compromised or lost reflexes
resulting from the denervation of the muscle fibers.

Disorders of the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Spinal Cord</span> In certain situations, such
as a motorcycle accident, only half of the spinal cord may be damaged in
what is known as a hemisection. Forceful trauma to the trunk may cause
ribs or vertebrae to fracture, and debris can crush or section through
part of the spinal cord. The full section of a spinal cord would result
in paraplegia, or loss of voluntary motor control of the lower body, as
well as loss of sensations from that point down. A hemisection, however,
will leave spinal cord tracts intact on one side. The resulting
condition would be hemiplegia on the side of the trauma—one leg would be
paralyzed. The sensory results are more complicated.

The ascending tracts in the spinal cord are segregated between the
dorsal column and spinothalamic pathways. This means that the sensory
deficits will be based on the particular sensory information each
pathway conveys. Sensory discrimination between touch and painful
stimuli will illustrate the difference in how these pathways divide
these functions.

On the paralyzed leg, a patient will acknowledge painful stimuli, but
not fine touch or proprioceptive sensations. On the functional leg, the
opposite is true. The reason for this is that the dorsal column pathway
ascends ipsilateral to the sensation, so it would be damaged the same
way as the lateral corticospinal tract. The spinothalamic pathway
decussates immediately upon entering the spinal cord and ascends
contralateral to the source; it would therefore bypass the hemisection.

The motor system can indicate the loss of input to the ventral horn in
the lumbar enlargement where motor neurons to the leg are found, but
motor function in the trunk is less clear. The left and right anterior
corticospinal tracts are directly adjacent to each other. The likelihood
of trauma to the spinal cord resulting in a hemisection that affects one
anterior column, but not the other, is very unlikely. Either the axial
musculature will not be affected at all, or there will be bilateral
losses in the trunk.

Sensory discrimination can pinpoint the level of damage in the spinal
cord. Below the hemisection, pain stimuli will be perceived in the
damaged side, but not fine touch. The opposite is true on the other
side. The pain fibers on the side with motor function cross the midline
in the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral lateral column as far
as the hemisection. The dorsal column will be intact ipsilateral to the
source on the intact side and reach the brain for conscious perception.
The trauma would be at the level just before sensory discrimination
returns to normal, helping to pinpoint the trauma. Whereas imaging
technology, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography
(CT) scanning, could localize the injury as well, nothing more
complicated than a cotton-tipped applicator can localize the damage.
That may be all that is available on the scene when moving the victim
requires crucial decisions be made.

# Chapter Review

The sensory and motor exams assess function related to the spinal cord
and the nerves connected to it. Sensory functions are associated with
the dorsal regions of the spinal cord, whereas motor function is
associated with the ventral side. Localizing damage to the spinal cord
is related to assessments of the peripheral projections mapped to
dermatomes.

Sensory tests address the various submodalities of the somatic senses:
touch, temperature, vibration, pain, and proprioception. Results of the
subtests can point to trauma in the spinal cord gray matter, white
matter, or even in connections to the cerebral cortex.

Motor tests focus on the function of the muscles and the connections of
the descending motor pathway. Muscle tone and strength are tested for
upper and lower extremities. Input to the muscles comes from the
descending cortical input of upper motor neurons and the direct
innervation of lower motor neurons.

Reflexes can either be based on deep stimulation of tendons or
superficial stimulation of the skin. The presence of reflexive
contractions helps to differentiate motor disorders between the upper
and lower motor neurons. The specific signs associated with motor
disorders can establish the difference further, based on the type of
paralysis, the state of muscle tone, and specific indicators such as
pronator drift or the Babinski sign.

The fingertips are the most sensitive skin on the hand, so the points of
the caliper can be closer together and still be recognized as two
separate points. On the palm, the sensitivity is less, so the points
need to be farther apart. This will continue on the arm and shoulder, as
sensitivity decreases, the discrimination of separate stimuli will be
