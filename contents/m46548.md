<div data-type="abstract" markdown="1">
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* List the structures that make up the respiratory system
* Describe how the respiratory system processes oxygen and
  CO<sub>2</sub>
* Compare and contrast the functions of upper respiratory tract with the
  lower respiratory tract

</div>
The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily to provide
oxygen to body tissues for cellular respiration, remove the waste
product carbon dioxide, and help to maintain acid-base balance. Portions
of the respiratory system are also used for non-vital functions, such as
sensing odors, speech production, and for straining, such as during
childbirth or coughing ([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_01){:

Functionally, the respiratory system can be divided into a conducting
zone and a respiratory zone. The <span data-type="term">conducting
zone</span> of the respiratory system includes the organs and structures
not directly involved in gas exchange. The gas exchange occurs in the
<span data-type="term">respiratory zone</span>.

# Conducting Zone
{: data-type="title"}

The major functions of the conducting zone are to provide a route for
incoming and outgoing air, remove debris and pathogens from the incoming
air, and warm and humidify the incoming air. Several structures within
the conducting zone perform other functions as well. The epithelium of
the nasal passages, for example, is essential to sensing odors, and the
bronchial epithelium that lines the lungs can metabolize some airborne
carcinogens.

## The Nose and its Adjacent Structures
{: data-type="title"}

The major entrance and exit for the respiratory system is through the
nose. When discussing the nose, it is helpful to divide it into two
major sections: the external nose, and the nasal cavity or internal
nose.
{: #fs-id2271107}

The <span data-type="term">external nose</span> consists of the surface
and skeletal structures that result in the outward appearance of the
nose and contribute to its numerous functions
([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_02){: .autogenerated-content}). The <span
data-type="term">root</span> is the region of the nose located between
the eyebrows. The <span data-type="term">bridge</span> is the part of
the nose that connects the root to the rest of the nose. The <span
data-type="term">dorsum nasi</span> is the length of the nose. The <span
data-type="term">apex</span> is the tip of the nose. On either side of
the apex, the nostrils are formed by the alae (singular = ala). An <span
data-type="term">ala</span> is a cartilaginous structure that forms the
lateral side of each <span data-type="term">naris</span> (plural =
nares), or nostril opening. The <span data-type="term">philtrum</span>
is the concave surface that connects the apex of the nose to the upper
lip.

</figure>
Underneath the thin skin of the nose are its skeletal features (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_02){: .autogenerated-content}, lower
illustration). While the root and bridge of the nose consist of bone,
the protruding portion of the nose is composed of cartilage. As a
result, when looking at a skull, the nose is missing. The <span
data-type="term">nasal bone</span> is one of a pair of bones that lies
under the root and bridge of the nose. The nasal bone articulates
superiorly with the frontal bone and laterally with the maxillary bones.
Septal cartilage is flexible hyaline cartilage connected to the nasal
bone, forming the dorsum nasi. The <span data-type="term">alar
cartilage</span> consists of the apex of the nose; it surrounds the
naris.
{: #fs-id1524638}

The nares open into the nasal cavity, which is separated into left and
right sections by the nasal septum ([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). The <span data-type="term">nasal septum</span>
is formed anteriorly by a portion of the septal cartilage (the flexible
portion you can touch with your fingers) and posteriorly by the
perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone (a cranial bone located just
posterior to the nasal bones) and the thin vomer bones (whose name
refers to its plough shape). Each lateral wall of the nasal cavity has
three bony projections, called the superior, middle, and inferior nasal
conchae. The inferior conchae are separate bones, whereas the superior
and middle conchae are portions of the ethmoid bone. Conchae serve to
increase the surface area of the nasal cavity and to disrupt the flow of
air as it enters the nose, causing air to bounce along the epithelium,
where it is cleaned and warmed. The conchae and <span
data-type="term">meatuses</span> also conserve water and prevent
dehydration of the nasal epithelium by trapping water during exhalation.
The floor of the nasal cavity is composed of the palate. The hard palate
at the anterior region of the nasal cavity is composed of bone. The soft
palate at the posterior portion of the nasal cavity consists of muscle
tissue. Air exits the nasal cavities via the internal nares and moves
into the pharynx.

Several bones that help form the walls of the nasal cavity have
air-containing spaces called the paranasal sinuses, which serve to warm
and humidify incoming air. Sinuses are lined with a mucosa. Each <span
data-type="term">paranasal sinus</span> is named for its associated
bone: frontal sinus, maxillary sinus, sphenoidal sinus, and ethmoidal
sinus. The sinuses produce mucus and lighten the weight of the skull.
{: #fs-id2864506}

The nares and anterior portion of the nasal cavities are lined with
mucous membranes, containing sebaceous glands and hair follicles that
serve to prevent the passage of large debris, such as dirt, through the
nasal cavity. An olfactory epithelium used to detect odors is found
deeper in the nasal cavity.
{: #fs-id806858}

The conchae, meatuses, and paranasal sinuses are lined by <span
data-type="term">respiratory epithelium</span> composed of
pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium
([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_04){: .autogenerated-content}). The epithelium
contains goblet cells, one of the specialized, columnar epithelial cells
that produce mucus to trap debris. The cilia of the respiratory
epithelium help remove the mucus and debris from the nasal cavity with a
constant beating motion, sweeping materials towards the throat to be
swallowed. Interestingly, cold air slows the movement of the cilia,
resulting in accumulation of mucus that may in turn lead to a runny nose
during cold weather. This moist epithelium functions to warm and
humidify incoming air. Capillaries located just beneath the nasal
epithelium warm the air by convection. Serous and mucus-producing cells
also secrete the lysozyme enzyme and proteins called defensins, which
have antibacterial properties. Immune cells that patrol the connective
tissue deep to the respiratory epithelium provide additional protection.

## Pharynx
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">pharynx</span> is a tube formed by skeletal
muscle and lined by mucous membrane that is continuous with that of the
nasal cavities (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). The pharynx is divided into three major
regions: the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and the laryngopharynx
([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_05){: .autogenerated-content}).

Divisions of the Pharynx

The pharynx is divided into three regions: the nasopharynx, the
oropharynx, and the laryngopharynx.

data-media-type="image/jpg" width="475"} </span>
</figure>
The <span data-type="term">nasopharynx</span> is flanked by the conchae
of the nasal cavity, and it serves only as an airway. At the top of the
nasopharynx are the pharyngeal tonsils. A <span
data-type="term">pharyngeal tonsil</span>, also called an adenoid, is an
aggregate of lymphoid reticular tissue similar to a lymph node that lies
at the superior portion of the nasopharynx. The function of the
pharyngeal tonsil is not well understood, but it contains a rich supply
of lymphocytes and is covered with ciliated epithelium that traps and
destroys invading pathogens that enter during inhalation. The pharyngeal
tonsils are large in children, but interestingly, tend to regress with
age and may even disappear. The uvula is a small bulbous,
teardrop-shaped structure located at the apex of the soft palate. Both
the uvula and soft palate move like a pendulum during swallowing,
swinging upward to close off the nasopharynx to prevent ingested
materials from entering the nasal cavity. In addition, auditory
(Eustachian) tubes that connect to each middle ear cavity open into the
nasopharynx. This connection is why colds often lead to ear infections.
{: #fs-id2591817}

The <span data-type="term">oropharynx</span> is a passageway for both
air and food. The oropharynx is bordered superiorly by the nasopharynx
and anteriorly by the oral cavity. The <span
data-type="term">fauces</span> is the opening at the connection between
the oral cavity and the oropharynx. As the nasopharynx becomes the
oropharynx, the epithelium changes from pseudostratified ciliated
columnar epithelium to stratified squamous epithelium. The oropharynx
contains two distinct sets of tonsils, the palatine and lingual tonsils.
A <span data-type="term">palatine tonsil</span> is one of a pair of
structures located laterally in the oropharynx in the area of the
fauces. The <span data-type="term">lingual tonsil</span> is located at
the base of the tongue. Similar to the pharyngeal tonsil, the palatine
and lingual tonsils are composed of lymphoid tissue, and trap and
destroy pathogens entering the body through the oral or nasal cavities.
{: #fs-id2641568}

The <span data-type="term">laryngopharynx</span> is inferior to the
oropharynx and posterior to the larynx. It continues the route for
ingested material and air until its inferior end, where the digestive
and respiratory systems diverge. The stratified squamous epithelium of
the oropharynx is continuous with the laryngopharynx. Anteriorly, the
laryngopharynx opens into the larynx, whereas posteriorly, it enters the
esophagus.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2679107" markdown="1">
## Larynx
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">larynx</span> is a cartilaginous structure
inferior to the laryngopharynx that connects the pharynx to the trachea
and helps regulate the volume of air that enters and leaves the lungs
([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_06){: .autogenerated-content}). The structure
of the larynx is formed by several pieces of cartilage. Three large
cartilage pieces—the thyroid cartilage (anterior), epiglottis
(superior), and cricoid cartilage (inferior)—form the major structure of
the larynx. The <span data-type="term">thyroid cartilage</span> is the
largest piece of cartilage that makes up the larynx. The thyroid
cartilage consists of the <span data-type="term">laryngeal
prominence</span>, or “Adam’s apple,” which tends to be more prominent
in males. The thick <span data-type="term">cricoid cartilage</span>
forms a ring, with a wide posterior region and a thinner anterior
region. Three smaller, paired cartilages—the arytenoids, corniculates,
and cuneiforms—attach to the epiglottis and the vocal cords and muscle
that help move the vocal cords to produce speech.

The <span data-type="term">epiglottis</span>, attached to the thyroid
cartilage, is a very flexible piece of elastic cartilage that covers the
opening of the trachea (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). When in the “closed” position, the unattached
end of the epiglottis rests on the glottis. The <span
data-type="term">glottis</span> is composed of the vestibular folds, the
true vocal cords, and the space between these folds
([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_07){: .autogenerated-content}). A <span
data-type="term">vestibular fold</span>, or false vocal cord, is one of
a pair of folded sections of mucous membrane. A <span
data-type="term">true vocal cord</span> is one of the white, membranous
folds attached by muscle to the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages of the
larynx on their outer edges. The inner edges of the true vocal cords are
free, allowing oscillation to produce sound. The size of the membranous
folds of the true vocal cords differs between individuals, producing
voices with different pitch ranges. Folds in males tend to be larger
than those in females, which create a deeper voice. The act of
swallowing causes the pharynx and larynx to lift upward, allowing the
pharynx to expand and the epiglottis of the larynx to swing downward,
closing the opening to the trachea. These movements produce a larger
area for food to pass through, while preventing food and beverages from
entering the trachea.

Continuous with the laryngopharynx, the superior portion of the larynx
is lined with stratified squamous epithelium, transitioning into
pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium that contains goblet
cells. Similar to the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, this specialized
epithelium produces mucus to trap debris and pathogens as they enter the
trachea. The cilia beat the mucus upward towards the laryngopharynx,
where it can be swallowed down the esophagus.

The trachea (windpipe) extends from the larynx toward the lungs
([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_08){: .autogenerated-content}**a**{:
data-effect="bold"}). The <span data-type="term">trachea</span> is
formed by 16 to 20 stacked, C-shaped pieces of hyaline cartilage that
are connected by dense connective tissue. The <span
data-type="term">trachealis muscle</span> and elastic connective tissue
together form the <span data-type="term">fibroelastic membrane</span>, a
flexible membrane that closes the posterior surface of the trachea,
connecting the C-shaped cartilages. The fibroelastic membrane allows the
trachea to stretch and expand slightly during inhalation and exhalation,
whereas the rings of cartilage provide structural support and prevent
the trachea from collapsing. In addition, the trachealis muscle can be
contracted to force air through the trachea during exhalation. The
trachea is lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium,
which is continuous with the larynx. The esophagus borders the trachea
posteriorly.

## Bronchial Tree
{: data-type="title"}

The trachea branches into the right and left primary <span
data-type="term">bronchi</span> at the carina. These bronchi are also
lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium containing
mucus-producing goblet cells ([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_08){:
.autogenerated-content}**b**{: data-effect="bold"}). The carina is a
raised structure that contains specialized nervous tissue that induces
violent coughing if a foreign body, such as food, is present. Rings of
cartilage, similar to those of the trachea, support the structure of the
bronchi and prevent their collapse. The primary bronchi enter the lungs
at the hilum, a concave region where blood vessels, lymphatic vessels,
and nerves also enter the lungs. The bronchi continue to branch into
bronchial a tree. A <span data-type="term">bronchial tree</span> (or
respiratory tree) is the collective term used for these
multiple-branched bronchi. The main function of the bronchi, like other
conducting zone structures, is to provide a passageway for air to move
into and out of each lung. In addition, the mucous membrane traps debris
and pathogens.
{: #fs-id2033350}

A <span data-type="term">bronchiole</span> branches from the tertiary
bronchi. Bronchioles, which are about 1 mm in diameter, further branch
until they become the tiny terminal bronchioles, which lead to the
structures of gas exchange. There are more than 1000 terminal
bronchioles in each lung. The muscular walls of the bronchioles do not
contain cartilage like those of the bronchi. This muscular wall can
change the size of the tubing to increase or decrease airflow through
the tube.

The alveolar wall consists of three major cell types: type I alveolar
cells, type II alveolar cells, and alveolar macrophages. A <span
data-type="term">type I alveolar cell</span> is a squamous epithelial
cell of the alveoli, which constitute up to 97 percent of the alveolar
surface area. These cells are about 25 nm thick and are highly permeable
to gases. A <span data-type="term">type II alveolar cell</span> is
interspersed among the type I cells and secretes <span
data-type="term">pulmonary surfactant</span>, a substance composed of
phospholipids and proteins that reduces the surface tension of the
alveoli. Roaming around the alveolar wall is the <span
data-type="term">alveolar macrophage</span>, a phagocytic cell of the
immune system that removes debris and pathogens that have reached the
alveoli.
{: #fs-id2201617}

The simple squamous epithelium formed by type I alveolar cells is
attached to a thin, elastic basement membrane. This epithelium is
extremely thin and borders the endothelial membrane of capillaries.
Taken together, the alveoli and capillary membranes form a <span
data-type="term">respiratory membrane</span> that is approximately 0.5
mm thick. The respiratory membrane allows gases to cross by simple
diffusion, allowing oxygen to be picked up by the blood for transport
and CO<sub>2 </sub>to be released into the air of the alveoli.

<span data-type="title">Respiratory System: Asthma</span> Asthma is
common condition that affects the lungs in both adults and children.
Approximately 8.2 percent of adults (18.7 million) and 9.4 percent of
children (7 million) in the United States suffer from asthma. In
addition, asthma is the most frequent cause of hospitalization in
children.
{: #fs-id2780125}

Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by inflammation and edema of
the airway, and bronchospasms (that is, constriction of the
bronchioles), which can inhibit air from entering the lungs. In
addition, excessive mucus secretion can occur, which further contributes
to airway occlusion ([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_01_11){:
.autogenerated-content}). Cells of the immune system, such as
eosinophils and mononuclear cells, may also be involved in infiltrating
the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles.
{: #fs-id2158367}

Bronchospasms occur periodically and lead to an “asthma attack.” An
attack may be triggered by environmental factors such as dust, pollen,
pet hair, or dander, changes in the weather, mold, tobacco smoke, and
respiratory infections, or by exercise and stress.

Symptoms of an asthma attack involve coughing, shortness of breath,
wheezing, and tightness of the chest. Symptoms of a severe asthma attack
that requires immediate medical attention would include difficulty
breathing that results in blue (cyanotic) lips or face, confusion,
drowsiness, a rapid pulse, sweating, and severe anxiety. The severity of
the condition, frequency of attacks, and identified triggers influence
the type of medication that an individual may require. Longer-term
treatments are used for those with more severe asthma. Short-term,
fast-acting drugs that are used to treat an asthma attack are typically
administered via an inhaler. For young children or individuals who have
difficulty using an inhaler, asthma medications can be administered via
a nebulizer.

In many cases, the underlying cause of the condition is unknown.
However, recent research has demonstrated that certain viruses, such as
human rhinovirus C (HRVC), and the bacteria *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*{:
data-effect="italics"} and *Chlamydia pneumoniae*{:
data-effect="italics"} that are contracted in infancy or early
childhood, may contribute to the development of many cases of asthma.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The respiratory system is responsible for obtaining oxygen and getting
rid of carbon dioxide, and aiding in speech production and in sensing
odors. From a functional perspective, the respiratory system can be
divided into two major areas: the conducting zone and the respiratory
zone. The conducting zone consists of all of the structures that provide
passageways for air to travel into and out of the lungs: the nasal
cavity, pharynx, trachea, bronchi, and most bronchioles. The nasal
passages contain the conchae and meatuses that expand the surface area
of the cavity, which helps to warm and humidify incoming air, while
removing debris and pathogens. The pharynx is composed of three major
sections: the nasopharynx, which is continuous with the nasal cavity;
the oropharynx, which borders the nasopharynx and the oral cavity; and
the laryngopharynx, which borders the oropharynx, trachea, and
esophagus. The respiratory zone includes the structures of the lung that
are directly involved in gas exchange: the terminal bronchioles and
alveoli.
{: #fs-id1483894}

The lining of the conducting zone is composed mostly of pseudostratified
ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet cells. The mucus traps
pathogens and debris, whereas beating cilia move the mucus superiorly
toward the throat, where it is swallowed. As the bronchioles become
smaller and smaller, and nearer the alveoli, the epithelium thins and is
simple squamous epithelium in the alveoli. The endothelium of the
surrounding capillaries, together with the alveolar epithelium, forms
the respiratory membrane. This is a blood-air barrier through which gas
exchange occurs by simple diffusion.

Describe the three regions of the pharynx and their functions.
{: #fs-id2591118}

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id2870963" data-label="" markdown="1">
The pharynx has three major regions. The first region is the
nasopharynx, which is connected to the posterior nasal cavity and
functions as an airway. The second region is the oropharynx, which is
continuous with the nasopharynx and is connected to the oral cavity at
the fauces. The laryngopharynx is connected to the oropharynx and the
esophagus and trachea. Both the oropharynx and laryngopharynx are
passageways for air and food and drink.

If a person sustains an injury to the epiglottis, what would be the
physiological result?
{: #fs-id2971502}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1905827" data-label="" markdown="1">
The epiglottis is a region of the larynx that is important during the
swallowing of food or drink. As a person swallows, the pharynx moves
upward and the epiglottis closes over the trachea, preventing food or
drink from entering the trachea. If a person’s epiglottis were injured,
this mechanism would be impaired. As a result, the person may have
problems with food or drink entering the trachea, and possibly, the
lungs. Over time, this may cause infections such as pneumonia to set in.

The conducting zone of the respiratory system includes the organs and
structures that are not directly involved in gas exchange, but perform
other duties such as providing a passageway for air, trapping and
removing debris and pathogens, and warming and humidifying incoming air.
Such structures include the nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and
most of the bronchial tree. The respiratory zone includes all the organs
and structures that are directly involved in gas exchange, including the
respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli.
