Carbohydrates are organic molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen atoms. The family of carbohydrates includes both simple and
complex sugars. Glucose and fructose are examples of simple sugars, and
starch, glycogen, and cellulose are all examples of complex sugars. The
complex sugars are also called <span
data-type="term">polysaccharides</span> and are made of multiple <span
data-type="term">monosaccharide</span> molecules. Polysaccharides serve
as energy storage (e.g., starch and glycogen) and as structural
components (e.g., chitin in insects and cellulose in plants).
{: #fs-id1595243}

During digestion, carbohydrates are broken down into simple, soluble
sugars that can be transported across the intestinal wall into the
circulatory system to be transported throughout the body. Carbohydrate
digestion begins in the mouth with the action of <span
data-type="term">salivary amylase</span> on starches and ends with
monosaccharides being absorbed across the epithelium of the small
intestine. Once the absorbed monosaccharides are transported to the
tissues, the process of <span data-type="term">cellular
respiration</span> begins ([\[link\]](#fig-ch25_02_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). This section will focus first on glycolysis, a
process where the monosaccharide glucose is oxidized, releasing the
energy stored in its bonds to produce ATP.

# Glycolysis
{: data-type="title"}

Glucose is the body’s most readily available source of energy. After
digestive processes break polysaccharides down into monosaccharides,
including glucose, the monosaccharides are transported across the wall
of the small intestine and into the circulatory system, which transports
them to the liver. In the liver, hepatocytes either pass the glucose on
through the circulatory system or store excess glucose as glycogen.
Cells in the body take up the circulating glucose in response to insulin
and, through a series of reactions called <span
data-type="term">glycolysis</span>, transfer some of the energy in
glucose to ADP to form ATP ([\[link\]](#fig-ch25_02_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). The last step in glycolysis produces the
product <span data-type="term">pyruvate</span>.
{: #fs-id2402389}

Glycolysis begins with the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase to
form glucose-6-phosphate. This step uses one ATP, which is the donor of
the phosphate group. Under the action of phosphofructokinase,
glucose-6-phosphate is converted into fructose-6-phosphate. At this
point, a second ATP donates its phosphate group, forming
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This six-carbon sugar is split to form two
phosphorylated three-carbon molecules, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and
dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which are both converted into
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is further
phosphorylated with groups donated by dihydrogen phosphate present in
the cell to form the three-carbon molecule 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The
energy of this reaction comes from the oxidation of (removal of
electrons from) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. In a series of reactions
leading to pyruvate, the two phosphate groups are then transferred to
two ADPs to form two ATPs. Thus, glycolysis uses two ATPs but generates
four ATPs, yielding a net gain of two ATPs and two molecules of
pyruvate. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate continues on to the Krebs
cycle (also called the <span data-type="term">citric acid cycle</span>
or <span data-type="term">tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)</span>, where
additional energy is extracted and passed on.

Glycolysis Overview
</div>
<figcaption>
During the energy-consuming phase of glycolysis, two ATPs are consumed,
transferring two phosphates to the glucose molecule. The glucose
molecule then splits into two three-carbon compounds, each containing a
phosphate. During the second phase, an additional phosphate is added to
each of the three-carbon compounds. The energy for this endergonic
reaction is provided by the removal (oxidation) of two electrons from
each three-carbon compound. During the energy-releasing phase, the
phosphates are removed from both three-carbon compounds and used to
produce four ATP molecules.

Glycolysis can be divided into two phases: energy consuming (also called
chemical priming) and energy yielding. The first phase is the <span
data-type="term">energy-consuming phase</span>, so it requires two ATP
molecules to start the reaction for each molecule of glucose. However,
the end of the reaction produces four ATPs, resulting in a net gain of
two ATP energy molecules.
{: #fs-id1618994}

Glycolysis can be expressed as the following equation:

This equation states that glucose, in combination with ATP (the energy
source), NAD<sup>+</sup> (a coenzyme that serves as an electron
acceptor), and inorganic phosphate, breaks down into two pyruvate
molecules, generating four ATP molecules—for a net yield of two ATP—and
two energy-containing NADH coenzymes. The NADH that is produced in this
process will be used later to produce ATP in the mitochondria.
Importantly, by the end of this process, one glucose molecule generates
two pyruvate molecules, two high-energy ATP molecules, and two
electron-carrying NADH molecules.
{: #fs-id1539388}

The following discussions of glycolysis include the enzymes responsible
for the reactions. When glucose enters a cell, the enzyme hexokinase (or
glucokinase, in the liver) rapidly adds a phosphate to convert it into
<span data-type="term">glucose-6-phosphate</span>. A kinase is a type of
enzyme that adds a phosphate molecule to a substrate (in this case,
glucose, but it can be true of other molecules also). This conversion
step requires one ATP and essentially traps the glucose in the cell,
preventing it from passing back through the plasma membrane, thus
allowing glycolysis to proceed. It also functions to maintain a
concentration gradient with higher glucose levels in the blood than in
the tissues. By establishing this concentration gradient, the glucose in
the blood will be able to flow from an area of high concentration (the
blood) into an area of low concentration (the tissues) to be either used
or stored. <span data-type="term">Hexokinase</span> is found in nearly
every tissue in the body. <span data-type="term">Glucokinase</span>, on
the other hand, is expressed in tissues that are active when blood
glucose levels are high, such as the liver. Hexokinase has a higher
affinity for glucose than glucokinase and therefore is able to convert
glucose at a faster rate than glucokinase. This is important when levels
of glucose are very low in the body, as it allows glucose to travel
preferentially to those tissues that require it more.
{: #fs-id1862692}

In the next step of the first phase of glycolysis, the enzyme
glucose-6-phosphate isomerase converts glucose-6-phosphate into
fructose-6-phosphate. Like glucose, fructose is also a six
carbon-containing sugar. The enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 then adds one
more phosphate to convert fructose-6-phosphate into
fructose-1-6-bisphosphate, another six-carbon sugar, using another ATP
molecule. Aldolase then breaks down this fructose-1-6-bisphosphate into
two three-carbon molecules, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and
dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The triosephosphate isomerase enzyme then
converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate into a second
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate molecule. Therefore, by the end of this
chemical-priming or energy-consuming phase, one glucose molecule is
broken down into two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate molecules.
{: #fs-id1984458}

The second phase of glycolysis, the <span
data-type="term">energy-yielding phase</span>, creates the energy that
is the product of glycolysis. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
converts each three-carbon glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate produced during
the energy-consuming phase into 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This reaction
releases an electron that is then picked up by NAD<sup>+</sup> to create
an NADH molecule. NADH is a high-energy molecule, like ATP, but unlike
ATP, it is not used as energy currency by the cell. Because there are
two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate molecules, two NADH molecules are
synthesized during this step. Each 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is
subsequently dephosphorylated (i.e., a phosphate is removed) by
phosphoglycerate kinase into 3-phosphoglycerate. Each phosphate released
in this reaction can convert one molecule of ADP into one high-energy
ATP molecule, resulting in a gain of two ATP molecules.
{: #fs-id2031924}

The enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase then converts the 3-phosphoglycerate
molecules into 2-phosphoglycerate. The enolase enzyme then acts upon the
2-phosphoglycerate molecules to convert them into phosphoenolpyruvate
molecules. The last step of glycolysis involves the dephosphorylation of
the two phosphoenolpyruvate molecules by pyruvate kinase to create two
pyruvate molecules and two ATP molecules.
{: #fs-id1749935}

In summary, one glucose molecule breaks down into two pyruvate
molecules, and creates two net ATP molecules and two NADH molecules by
glycolysis. Therefore, glycolysis generates energy for the cell and
creates pyruvate molecules that can be processed further through the
aerobic Krebs cycle (also called the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic
acid cycle); converted into lactic acid or alcohol (in yeast) by
fermentation; or used later for the synthesis of glucose through
gluconeogenesis.

## Anaerobic Respiration
{: data-type="title"}

When oxygen is limited or absent, pyruvate enters an anaerobic pathway.
In these reactions, pyruvate can be converted into lactic acid. In
addition to generating an additional ATP, this pathway serves to keep
the pyruvate concentration low so glycolysis continues, and it oxidizes
NADH into the NAD<sup>+</sup> needed by glycolysis. In this reaction,
lactic acid replaces oxygen as the final electron acceptor. Anaerobic
respiration occurs in most cells of the body when oxygen is limited or
mitochondria are absent or nonfunctional. For example, because
erythrocytes (red blood cells) lack mitochondria, they must produce
their ATP from anaerobic respiration. This is an effective pathway of
ATP production for short periods of time, ranging from seconds to a few
minutes. The lactic acid produced diffuses into the plasma and is
carried to the liver, where it is converted back into pyruvate or
glucose via the Cori cycle. Similarly, when a person exercises, muscles
use ATP faster than oxygen can be delivered to them. They depend on
glycolysis and lactic acid production for rapid ATP production.

In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate can enter the Krebs cycle where
additional energy is extracted as electrons are transferred from the
pyruvate to the receptors NAD<sup>+</sup>, GDP, and FAD, with carbon
dioxide being a “waste product” ([\[link\]](#fig-ch25_02_03){:

on to the electron transport chain, which uses the transferred energy to
produce ATP. As the terminal step in the electron transport chain,
oxygen is the <span data-type="term">terminal electron acceptor</span>

{: #fs-id1332013}

</div>
The three-carbon pyruvate molecule generated during glycolysis moves
from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is converted
by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase into a two-carbon <span
data-type="term">acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA)</span> molecule. This
reaction is an oxidative decarboxylation reaction. It converts the
three-carbon pyruvate into a two-carbon acetyl CoA molecule, releasing
carbon dioxide and transferring two electrons that combine with
NAD<sup>+</sup> to form NADH. Acetyl CoA enters the Krebs cycle by
combining with a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form the
six-carbon molecule citrate, or citric acid, at the same time releasing
the coenzyme A molecule.
{: #fs-id2019072}

The six-carbon citrate molecule is systematically converted to a
five-carbon molecule and then a four-carbon molecule, ending with
oxaloacetate, the beginning of the cycle. Along the way, each citrate
molecule will produce one ATP, one FADH<sub>2</sub>, and three NADH. The
FADH<sub>2</sub> and NADH will enter the oxidative phosphorylation
system located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. In addition, the
Krebs cycle supplies the starting materials to process and break down
proteins and fats.
{: #fs-id1336395}

To start the Krebs cycle, citrate synthase combines acetyl CoA and
oxaloacetate to form a six-carbon citrate molecule; CoA is subsequently
released and can combine with another pyruvate molecule to begin the
cycle again. The aconitase enzyme converts citrate into isocitrate. In
two successive steps of oxidative decarboxylation, two molecules of
CO<sub>2</sub> and two NADH molecules are produced when isocitrate
dehydrogenase converts isocitrate into the five-carbon α-ketoglutarate,
which is then catalyzed and converted into the four-carbon succinyl CoA
by α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The enzyme succinyl CoA dehydrogenase
then converts succinyl CoA into succinate and forms the high-energy
molecule GTP, which transfers its energy to ADP to produce ATP.
Succinate dehydrogenase then converts succinate into fumarate, forming a
molecule of FADH<sub>2</sub>. Fumarase then converts fumarate into
malate, which malate dehydrogenase then converts back into oxaloacetate
while reducing NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. Oxaloacetate is then ready to
combine with the next acetyl CoA to start the Krebs cycle again (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch25_02_04){: .autogenerated-content}). For each turn of
the cycle, three NADH, one ATP (through GTP), and one FADH<sub>2
</sub>are created. Each carbon of pyruvate is converted into
CO<sub>2</sub>, which is released as a byproduct of oxidative (aerobic)
respiration.

# Oxidative Phosphorylation and the Electron Transport Chain
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">electron transport chain (ETC)</span> uses
the NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> produced by the Krebs cycle to generate
ATP. Electrons from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are transferred through
protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane by a
series of enzymatic reactions. The electron transport chain consists of
a series of four enzyme complexes (Complex I – Complex IV) and two
coenzymes (ubiquinone and Cytochrome c), which act as electron carriers
and proton pumps used to transfer H<sup>+</sup> ions into the space
between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes
([\[link\]](#fig-ch25_02_05){: .autogenerated-content}). The ETC couples
the transfer of electrons between a donor (like NADH) and an electron
acceptor (like O<sub>2</sub>) with the transfer of protons
(H<sup>+</sup> ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, enabling
the process of <span data-type="term">oxidative phosphorylation</span>.
In the presence of oxygen, energy is passed, stepwise, through the
electron carriers to collect gradually the energy needed to attach a
phosphate to ADP and produce ATP. The role of molecular oxygen,
O<sub>2</sub>, is as the terminal electron acceptor for the ETC. This
means that once the electrons have passed through the entire ETC, they
must be passed to another, separate molecule. These electrons,
O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sup>+</sup> ions from the matrix combine to form
new water molecules. This is the basis for your need to breathe in
oxygen. Without oxygen, electron flow through the ETC ceases.

Watch this [video][3] to learn about the electron transport chain.

</div>
The electrons released from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are passed along
the chain by each of the carriers, which are reduced when they receive
the electron and oxidized when passing it on to the next carrier. Each
of these reactions releases a small amount of energy, which is used to
pump H<sup>+</sup> ions across the inner membrane. The accumulation of
these protons in the space between the membranes creates a proton
gradient with respect to the mitochondrial matrix.
{: #fs-id2066971}

Also embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane is an amazing protein
pore complex called <span data-type="term">ATP synthase</span>.
Effectively, it is a turbine that is powered by the flow of H<sup>+
</sup>ions across the inner membrane down a gradient and into the
mitochondrial matrix. As the H<sup>+ </sup>ions traverse the complex,
the shaft of the complex rotates. This rotation enables other portions
of ATP synthase to encourage ADP and P*<sub>i</sub>*{:
data-effect="italics"} to create ATP. In accounting for the total number
of ATP produced per glucose molecule through aerobic respiration, it is
important to remember the following points:
{: #fs-id2174043}

* A net of two ATP are produced through glycolysis (four produced and
  two consumed during the energy-consuming stage). However, these two
  ATP are used for transporting the NADH produced during glycolysis from
  the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. Therefore, the net production of
  ATP during glycolysis is zero.
* In all phases after glycolysis, the number of ATP, NADH, and
  FADH<sub>2</sub> produced must be multiplied by two to reflect how
  each glucose molecule produces two pyruvate molecules.
* In the ETC, about three ATP are produced for every oxidized NADH.
  However, only about two ATP are produced for every oxidized
  FADH<sub>2</sub>. The electrons from FADH<sub>2</sub> produce less
  ATP, because they start at a lower point in the ETC (Complex II)
  compared to the electrons from NADH (Complex I) (see
  [\[link\]](#fig-ch25_02_05){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id3046631}

Therefore, for every glucose molecule that enters aerobic respiration, a
net total of 36 ATPs are produced ([\[link\]](#fig-ch25_02_06){:

# Gluconeogenesis
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Gluconeogenesis</span> is the synthesis of new
glucose molecules from pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, or the amino acids
alanine or glutamine. This process takes place primarily in the liver
during periods of low glucose, that is, under conditions of fasting,
starvation, and low carbohydrate diets. So, the question can be raised
as to why the body would create something it has just spent a fair
amount of effort to break down? Certain key organs, including the brain,
can use only glucose as an energy source; therefore, it is essential
that the body maintain a minimum blood glucose concentration. When the
blood glucose concentration falls below that certain point, new glucose
is synthesized by the liver to raise the blood concentration to normal.
{: #fs-id1805372}

Gluconeogenesis is not simply the reverse of glycolysis. There are some
important differences ([\[link\]](#fig-ch25_02_07){:
.autogenerated-content}). Pyruvate is a common starting material for
gluconeogenesis. First, the pyruvate is converted into oxaloacetate.
Oxaloacetate then serves as a substrate for the enzyme
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), which transforms oxaloacetate
into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). From this step, gluconeogenesis is
nearly the reverse of glycolysis. PEP is converted back into
2-phosphoglycerate, which is converted into 3-phosphoglycerate. Then,
3-phosphoglycerate is converted into 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate and then
into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Two molecules of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate then combine to form
fructose-1-6-bisphosphate, which is converted into fructose 6-phosphate
and then into glucose-6-phosphate. Finally, a series of reactions
generates glucose itself. In gluconeogenesis (as compared to
glycolysis), the enzyme hexokinase is replaced by glucose-6-phosphatase,
and the enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 is replaced by
fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. This helps the cell to regulate glycolysis

As will be discussed as part of lipolysis, fats can be broken down into
glycerol, which can be phosphorylated to form dihydroxyacetone phosphate
or DHAP. DHAP can either enter the glycolytic pathway or be used by the
liver as a substrate for gluconeogenesis.

<span data-type="title">Body’s Metabolic Rate</span> The human body’s
metabolic rate decreases nearly 2 percent per decade after age 30.
Changes in body composition, including reduced lean muscle mass, are
mostly responsible for this decrease. The most dramatic loss of muscle
mass, and consequential decline in metabolic rate, occurs between 50 and
70 years of age. Loss of muscle mass is the equivalent of reduced
strength, which tends to inhibit seniors from engaging in sufficient
physical activity. This results in a positive-feedback system where the
reduced physical activity leads to even more muscle loss, further
reducing metabolism.
{: #fs-id1744205}

There are several things that can be done to help prevent general
declines in metabolism and to fight back against the cyclic nature of
these declines. These include eating breakfast, eating small meals
frequently, consuming plenty of lean protein, drinking water to remain
hydrated, exercising (including strength training), and getting enough
sleep. These measures can help keep energy levels from dropping and curb
the urge for increased calorie consumption from excessive snacking.
While these strategies are not guaranteed to maintain metabolism, they
do help prevent muscle loss and may increase energy levels. Some experts
also suggest avoiding sugar, which can lead to excess fat storage. Spicy
foods and green tea might also be beneficial. Because stress activates
cortisol release, and cortisol slows metabolism, avoiding stress, or at
least practicing relaxation techniques, can also help.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Metabolic enzymes catalyze catabolic reactions that break down
carbohydrates contained in food. The energy released is used to power
the cells and systems that make up your body. Excess or unutilized
energy is stored as fat or glycogen for later use. Carbohydrate
metabolism begins in the mouth, where the enzyme salivary amylase begins
to break down complex sugars into monosaccharides. These can then be
transported across the intestinal membrane into the bloodstream and then
to body tissues. In the cells, glucose, a six-carbon sugar, is processed
through a sequence of reactions into smaller sugars, and the energy
stored inside the molecule is released. The first step of carbohydrate
catabolism is glycolysis, which produces pyruvate, NADH, and ATP. Under
anaerobic conditions, the pyruvate can be converted into lactate to keep
glycolysis working. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the Krebs
cycle, also called the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle. In
addition to ATP, the Krebs cycle produces high-energy FADH<sub>2</sub>
and NADH molecules, which provide electrons to the oxidative
phosphorylation process that generates more high-energy ATP molecules.
For each molecule of glucose that is processed in glycolysis, a net of
36 ATPs can be created by aerobic respiration.
{: #fs-id2499200}

Under anaerobic conditions, ATP production is limited to those generated
by glycolysis. While a total of four ATPs are produced by glycolysis,
two are needed to begin glycolysis, so there is a net yield of two ATP
molecules.
{: #fs-id2184396}

In conditions of low glucose, such as fasting, starvation, or low
carbohydrate diets, glucose can be synthesized from lactate, pyruvate,
glycerol, alanine, or glutamate. This process, called gluconeogenesis,
is almost the reverse of glycolysis and serves to create glucose
molecules for glucose-dependent organs, such as the brain, when glucose
levels fall below normal.
