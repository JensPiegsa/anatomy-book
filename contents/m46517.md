</div>
Although a minimal amount of carbohydrate digestion occurs in the mouth,
chemical digestion really gets underway in the stomach. An expansion of
the alimentary canal that lies immediately inferior to the esophagus,
the stomach links the esophagus to the first part of the small intestine
(the duodenum) and is relatively fixed in place at its esophageal and
duodenal ends. In between, however, it can be a highly active structure,
contracting and continually changing position and size. These
contractions provide mechanical assistance to digestion. The empty
stomach is only about the size of your fist, but can stretch to hold as
much as 4 liters of food and fluid, or more than 75 times its empty
volume, and then return to its resting size when empty. Although you
might think that the size of a person’s stomach is related to how much
food that individual consumes, body weight does not correlate with
stomach size. Rather, when you eat greater quantities of food—such as at
holiday dinner—you stretch the stomach more than when you eat less.
{: #fs-id2151539}

Popular culture tends to refer to the stomach as the location where all
digestion takes place. Of course, this is not true. An important
function of the stomach is to serve as a temporary holding chamber. You
can ingest a meal far more quickly than it can be digested and absorbed
by the small intestine. Thus, the stomach holds food and parses only
small amounts into the small intestine at a time. Foods are not
processed in the order they are eaten; rather, they are mixed together
with digestive juices in the stomach until they are converted into
chyme, which is released into the small intestine.
{: #fs-id1477027}

As you will see in the sections that follow, the stomach plays several
important roles in chemical digestion, including the continued digestion
of carbohydrates and the initial digestion of proteins and
triglycerides. Little if any nutrient absorption occurs in the stomach,
with the exception of the negligible amount of nutrients in alcohol.

# Structure
{: data-type="title"}

There are four main regions in the <span
data-type="term">stomach</span>\: the cardia, fundus, body, and pylorus
([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_04_01){: .autogenerated-content}). The <span
data-type="term">cardia</span> (or cardiac region) is the point where
the esophagus connects to the stomach and through which food passes into
the stomach. Located inferior to the diaphragm, above and to the left of
the cardia, is the dome-shaped <span data-type="term">fundus</span>.
Below the fundus is the <span data-type="term">body</span>, the main
part of the stomach. The funnel-shaped <span
data-type="term">pylorus</span> connects the stomach to the duodenum.
The wider end of the funnel, the <span data-type="term">pyloric
antrum</span>, connects to the body of the stomach. The narrower end is
called the <span data-type="term">pyloric canal</span>, which connects
to the duodenum. The smooth muscle <span data-type="term">pyloric
sphincter</span> is located at this latter point of connection and
controls stomach emptying. In the absence of food, the stomach deflates
inward, and its mucosa and submucosa fall into a large fold called a
<span data-type="term">ruga</span>.

The convex lateral surface of the stomach is called the greater
curvature; the concave medial border is the lesser curvature. The
stomach is held in place by the lesser omentum, which extends from the
liver to the lesser curvature, and the greater omentum, which runs from
the greater curvature to the posterior abdominal wall.

# Histology
{: data-type="title"}

The wall of the stomach is made of the same four layers as most of the
rest of the alimentary canal, but with adaptations to the mucosa and
muscularis for the unique functions of this organ. In addition to the
typical circular and longitudinal smooth muscle layers, the muscularis
has an inner oblique smooth muscle layer ([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_04_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). As a result, in addition to moving food
through the canal, the stomach can vigorously churn food, mechanically
breaking it down into smaller particles.

The stomach wall is adapted for the functions of the stomach. In the
epithelium, gastric pits lead to gastric glands that secrete gastric
juice. The gastric glands (one gland is shown enlarged on the right)
contain different types of cells that secrete a variety of enzymes,
including hydrochloride acid, which activates the protein-digesting
enzyme pepsin.

</figure>
The stomach mucosa’s epithelial lining consists only of surface mucus
cells, which secrete a protective coat of alkaline mucus. A vast number
of <span data-type="term">gastric pits</span> dot the surface of the
epithelium, giving it the appearance of a well-used pincushion, and mark
the entry to each <span data-type="term">gastric gland</span>, which
secretes a complex digestive fluid referred to as gastric juice.
{: #fs-id1701706}

Although the walls of the gastric pits are made up primarily of mucus
cells, the gastric glands are made up of different types of cells. The
glands of the cardia and pylorus are composed primarily of
mucus-secreting cells. Cells that make up the pyloric antrum secrete
mucus and a number of hormones, including the majority of the
stimulatory hormone, <span data-type="term">gastrin</span>. The much
larger glands of the fundus and body of the stomach, the site of most
chemical digestion, produce most of the gastric secretions. These glands
are made up of a variety of secretory cells. These include parietal
cells, chief cells, mucous neck cells, and enteroendocrine cells.
{: #fs-id810540}

*Parietal cells*{: data-effect="italics"}—Located primarily in the
middle region of the gastric glands are <span data-type="term">parietal
cells</span>, which are among the most highly differentiated of the
body’s epithelial cells. These relatively large cells produce both <span
data-type="term">hydrochloric acid (HCl)</span> and <span
data-type="term">intrinsic factor</span>. HCl is responsible for the
high acidity (pH 1.5 to 3.5) of the stomach contents and is needed to
activate the protein-digesting enzyme, pepsin. The acidity also kills
much of the bacteria you ingest with food and helps to denature
proteins, making them more available for enzymatic digestion. Intrinsic
factor is a glycoprotein necessary for the absorption of vitamin
B<sub>12</sub> in the small intestine.
{: #fs-id1959017}

*Chief cells*{: data-effect="italics"}—Located primarily in the basal
regions of gastric glands are <span data-type="term">chief cells</span>,
which secrete <span data-type="term">pepsinogen</span>, the inactive
proenzyme form of pepsin. HCl is necessary for the conversion of
pepsinogen to pepsin.
{: #fs-id1905668}

*Mucous neck cells*{: data-effect="italics"}—Gastric glands in the upper
part of the stomach contain <span data-type="term">mucous neck

the mucus secreted by the goblet cells of the surface epithelium. The
role of this mucus is not currently known.

*Enteroendocrine cells*{: data-effect="italics"}—Finally, <span

# Gastric Secretion
{: data-type="title"}

The secretion of gastric juice is controlled by both nerves and
hormones. Stimuli in the brain, stomach, and small intestine activate or
inhibit gastric juice production. This is why the three phases of
gastric secretion are called the cephalic, gastric, and intestinal
phases ([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_04_03){: .autogenerated-content}). However,
once gastric secretion begins, all three phases can occur
simultaneously.
{: #fs-id1481100}

<figure id="fig-ch24_04_03">
<div data-type="title">
The Three Phases of Gastric Secretion
</div>
<figcaption>
Gastric secretion occurs in three phases: cephalic, gastric, and
intestinal. During each phase, the secretion of gastric juice can be
stimulated or inhibited.
</figcaption>
<span markdown="1" data-type="media" id="fs-id1394707" data-alt="This flowchart shows
the three different phases of gastric secretion. The top panel shows the
cephalic phase, the middle panel shows the gastric phase and the bottom

phase.](../resources/2416_Three_Phases_Gastric_Secretion.jpg){:
data-media-type="image/jpg" width="450"} </span>
</figure>
The <span data-type="term">cephalic phase</span> (reflex phase) of
gastric secretion, which is relatively brief, takes place before food
enters the stomach. The smell, taste, sight, or thought of food triggers
this phase. For example, when you bring a piece of sushi to your lips,
impulses from receptors in your taste buds or the nose are relayed to
your brain, which returns signals that increase gastric secretion to
prepare your stomach for digestion. This enhanced secretion is a
conditioned reflex, meaning it occurs only if you like or want a
particular food. Depression and loss of appetite can suppress the
cephalic reflex.
{: #fs-id1284564}

The <span data-type="term">gastric phase</span> of secretion lasts 3 to
4 hours, and is set in motion by local neural and hormonal mechanisms
triggered by the entry of food into the stomach. For example, when your
sushi reaches the stomach, it creates distention that activates the
stretch receptors. This stimulates parasympathetic neurons to release
acetylcholine, which then provokes increased secretion of gastric juice.
Partially digested proteins, caffeine, and rising pH stimulate the
release of gastrin from enteroendocrine G cells, which in turn induces
parietal cells to increase their production of HCl, which is needed to
create an acidic environment for the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin,
and protein digestion. Additionally, the release of gastrin activates
vigorous smooth muscle contractions. However, it should be noted that
the stomach does have a natural means of avoiding excessive acid
secretion and potential heartburn. Whenever pH levels drop too low,
cells in the stomach react by suspending HCl secretion and increasing
mucous secretions.
{: #fs-id1895143}

The <span data-type="term">intestinal phase</span> of gastric secretion
has both excitatory and inhibitory elements. The duodenum has a major
role in regulating the stomach and its emptying. When partially digested
food fills the duodenum, intestinal mucosal cells release a hormone
called intestinal (enteric) gastrin, which further excites gastric juice
secretion. This stimulatory activity is brief, however, because when the
intestine distends with chyme, the enterogastric reflex inhibits
secretion. One of the effects of this reflex is to close the pyloric
sphincter, which blocks additional chyme from entering the duodenum.

# The Mucosal Barrier
{: data-type="title"}

The mucosa of the stomach is exposed to the highly corrosive acidity of
gastric juice. Gastric enzymes that can digest protein can also digest
the stomach itself. The stomach is protected from self-digestion by the
<span data-type="term">mucosal barrier</span>. This barrier has several
components. First, the stomach wall is covered by a thick coating of
bicarbonate-rich mucus. This mucus forms a physical barrier, and its
bicarbonate ions neutralize acid. Second, the epithelial cells of the
stomach\'s mucosa meet at tight junctions, which block gastric juice
from penetrating the underlying tissue layers. Finally, stem cells
located where gastric glands join the gastric pits quickly replace
damaged epithelial mucosal cells, when the epithelial cells are shed. In
fact, the surface epithelium of the stomach is completely replaced every
3 to 6 days.

Homeostatic Imbalances
</div>
<span data-type="title">Ulcers: When the Mucosal Barrier Breaks
Down</span> As effective as the mucosal barrier is, it is not a
“fail-safe” mechanism. Sometimes, gastric juice eats away at the
superficial lining of the stomach mucosa, creating erosions, which
mostly heal on their own. Deeper and larger erosions are called ulcers.
{: #fs-id1632870}

Why does the mucosal barrier break down? A number of factors can
interfere with its ability to protect the stomach lining. The majority
of all ulcers are caused by either excessive intake of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, or *Helicobacter
pylori*{: data-effect="italics"} infection.
{: #fs-id2023452}

Antacids help relieve symptoms of ulcers such as “burning” pain and
indigestion. When ulcers are caused by NSAID use, switching to other
classes of pain relievers allows healing. When caused by *H. pylori*{:
data-effect="italics"} infection, antibiotics are effective.
{: #fs-id1070208}

A potential complication of ulcers is perforation: Perforated ulcers
create a hole in the stomach wall, resulting in peritonitis
(inflammation of the peritoneum). These ulcers must be repaired
surgically.

# Digestive Functions of the Stomach
{: data-type="title"}

The stomach participates in virtually all the digestive activities with
the exception of ingestion and defecation. Although almost all
absorption takes place in the small intestine, the stomach does absorb
some nonpolar substances, such as alcohol and aspirin.
{: #fs-id1953558}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1240632" markdown="1">
## Mechanical Digestion
{: data-type="title"}

Within a few moments after food after enters your stomach, mixing waves
begin to occur at intervals of approximately 20 seconds. A <span
data-type="term">mixing wave</span> is a unique type of peristalsis that
mixes and softens the food with gastric juices to create chyme. The
initial mixing waves are relatively gentle, but these are followed by
more intense waves, starting at the body of the stomach and increasing
in force as they reach the pylorus. It is fair to say that long before
your sushi exits through the pyloric sphincter, it bears little
resemblance to the sushi you ate.
{: #fs-id1890948}

The pylorus, which holds around 30 mL (1 fluid ounce) of chyme, acts as
a filter, permitting only liquids and small food particles to pass
through the mostly, but not fully, closed pyloric sphincter. In a
process called <span data-type="term">gastric emptying</span>, rhythmic
mixing waves force about 3 mL of chyme at a time through the pyloric
sphincter and into the duodenum. Release of a greater amount of chyme at
one time would overwhelm the capacity of the small intestine to handle
it. The rest of the chyme is pushed back into the body of the stomach,
where it continues mixing. This process is repeated when the next mixing
waves force more chyme into the duodenum.
{: #fs-id789222}

Gastric emptying is regulated by both the stomach and the duodenum. The
presence of chyme in the duodenum activates receptors that inhibit
gastric secretion. This prevents additional chyme from being released by
the stomach before the duodenum is ready to process it.
{: #fs-id1652937}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1548496" markdown="1">
## Chemical Digestion
{: data-type="title"}

The fundus plays an important role, because it stores both undigested
food and gases that are released during the process of chemical
digestion. Food may sit in the fundus of the stomach for a while before
being mixed with the chyme. While the food is in the fundus, the
digestive activities of salivary amylase continue until the food begins
mixing with the acidic chyme. Ultimately, mixing waves incorporate this
food with the chyme, the acidity of which inactivates salivary amylase
and activates lingual lipase. Lingual lipase then begins breaking down
triglycerides into free fatty acids, and mono- and diglycerides.
{: #fs-id1006118}

The breakdown of protein begins in the stomach through the actions of
HCl and the enzyme pepsin. During infancy, gastric glands also produce
rennin, an enzyme that helps digest milk protein.
{: #fs-id1933550}

Its numerous digestive functions notwithstanding, there is only one
stomach function necessary to life: the production of intrinsic factor.
The intestinal absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, which is necessary
for both the production of mature red blood cells and normal
neurological functioning, cannot occur without intrinsic factor. People
who undergo total gastrectomy (stomach removal)—for life-threatening
stomach cancer, for example—can survive with minimal digestive
dysfunction if they receive vitamin B<sub>12</sub> injections.
{: #fs-id1584118}

The contents of the stomach are completely emptied into the duodenum
within 2 to 4 hours after you eat a meal. Different types of food take
different amounts of time to process. Foods heavy in carbohydrates empty
fastest, followed by high-protein foods. Meals with a high triglyceride
content remain in the stomach the longest. Since enzymes in the small
intestine digest fats slowly, food can stay in the stomach for 6 hours
or longer when the duodenum is processing fatty chyme. However, note
that this is still a fraction of the 24 to 72 hours that full digestion
typically takes from start to finish.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The stomach participates in all digestive activities except ingestion
and defecation. It vigorously churns food. It secretes gastric juices
that break down food and absorbs certain drugs, including aspirin and
some alcohol. The stomach begins the digestion of protein and continues
the digestion of carbohydrates and fats. It stores food as an acidic
liquid called chyme, and releases it gradually into the small intestine
through the pyloric sphincter.
