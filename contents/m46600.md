Chapter Objectives
</div>
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* Compare and contrast the anatomical structure of arteries, arterioles,
  capillaries, venules, and veins
* Accurately describe the forces that account for capillary exchange
* List the major factors affecting blood flow, blood pressure, and
  resistance
* Describe how blood flow, blood pressure, and resistance interrelate
* Discuss how the neural and endocrine mechanisms maintain homeostasis
  within the blood vessels
* Describe the interaction of the cardiovascular system with other body
  systems
* Label the major blood vessels of the pulmonary and systemic
  circulations
* Identify and describe the hepatic portal system
* Describe the development of blood vessels and fetal circulation
* Compare fetal circulation to that of an individual after birth

</div>
In this chapter, you will learn about the vascular part of the
cardiovascular system, that is, the vessels that transport blood
throughout the body and provide the physical site where gases,
nutrients, and other substances are exchanged with body cells. When
vessel functioning is reduced, blood-borne substances do not circulate
effectively throughout the body. As a result, tissue injury occurs,
metabolism is impaired, and the functions of every bodily system are
threatened.
