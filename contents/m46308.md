<span data-type="term">Fertilization</span> occurs when a sperm and an
oocyte (egg) combine and their nuclei fuse. Because each of these
reproductive cells is a haploid cell containing half of the genetic
material needed to form a human being, their combination forms a diploid
cell. This new single cell, called a <span
data-type="term">zygote</span>, contains all of the genetic material
needed to form a human—half from the mother and half from the father.

# Transit of Sperm
{: data-type="title"}

Fertilization is a numbers game. During ejaculation, hundreds of
millions of sperm (spermatozoa) are released into the vagina. Almost
immediately, millions of these sperm are overcome by the acidity of the
vagina (approximately pH 3.8), and millions more may be blocked from
entering the uterus by thick cervical mucus. Of those that do enter,
thousands are destroyed by phagocytic uterine leukocytes. Thus, the race
into the uterine tubes, which is the most typical site for sperm to
encounter the oocyte, is reduced to a few thousand contenders. Their
journey—thought to be facilitated by uterine contractions—usually takes
from 30 minutes to 2 hours. If the sperm do not encounter an oocyte
immediately, they can survive in the uterine tubes for another 3–5 days.
Thus, fertilization can still occur if intercourse takes place a few
days before ovulation. In comparison, an oocyte can survive
independently for only approximately 24 hours following ovulation.
Intercourse more than a day after ovulation will therefore usually not
result in fertilization.
{: #fs-id1723898}

During the journey, fluids in the female reproductive tract prepare the
sperm for fertilization through a process called <span
data-type="term">capacitation</span>, or priming. The fluids improve the
motility of the spermatozoa. They also deplete cholesterol molecules
embedded in the membrane of the head of the sperm, thinning the membrane
in such a way that will help facilitate the release of the lysosomal
(digestive) enzymes needed for the sperm to penetrate the oocyte’s
exterior once contact is made. Sperm must undergo the process of
capacitation in order to have the “capacity” to fertilize an oocyte. If
they reach the oocyte before capacitation is complete, they will be
unable to penetrate the oocyte’s thick outer layer of cells.

# Contact Between Sperm and Oocyte
{: data-type="title"}

Upon ovulation, the oocyte released by the ovary is swept into—and
along—the uterine tube. Fertilization must occur in the distal uterine
tube because an unfertilized oocyte cannot survive the 72-hour journey
to the uterus. As you will recall from your study of the oogenesis, this
oocyte (specifically a secondary oocyte) is surrounded by two protective
layers. The <span data-type="term">corona radiata</span> is an outer
layer of follicular (granulosa) cells that form around a developing
oocyte in the ovary and remain with it upon ovulation. The underlying
<span data-type="term">zona pellucida</span> (pellucid = “transparent”)
is a transparent, but thick, glycoprotein membrane that surrounds the
cell’s plasma membrane.
{: #fs-id1476098}

As it is swept along the distal uterine tube, the oocyte encounters the
surviving capacitated sperm, which stream toward it in response to
chemical attractants released by the cells of the corona radiata. To
reach the oocyte itself, the sperm must penetrate the two protective
layers. The sperm first burrow through the cells of the corona radiata.
Then, upon contact with the zona pellucida, the sperm bind to receptors
in the zona pellucida. This initiates a process called the <span
data-type="term">acrosomal reaction</span> in which the enzyme-filled
“cap” of the sperm, called the <span data-type="term">acrosome</span>,
releases its stored digestive enzymes. These enzymes clear a path
through the zona pellucida that allows sperm to reach the oocyte.
Finally, a single sperm makes contact with sperm-binding receptors on
the oocyte’s plasma membrane ([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_01_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). The plasma membrane of that sperm then fuses
with the oocyte’s plasma membrane, and the head and mid-piece of the
“winning” sperm enter the oocyte interior.
{: #fs-id1399017}

How do sperm penetrate the corona radiata? Some sperm undergo a
spontaneous acrosomal reaction, which is an acrosomal reaction not
triggered by contact with the zona pellucida. The digestive enzymes
released by this reaction digest the extracellular matrix of the corona
radiata. As you can see, the first sperm to reach the oocyte is never
the one to fertilize it. Rather, hundreds of sperm cells must undergo
the acrosomal reaction, each helping to degrade the corona radiata and
zona pellucida until a path is created to allow one sperm to contact and
fuse with the plasma membrane of the oocyte. If you consider the loss of
millions of sperm between entry into the vagina and degradation of the
zona pellucida, you can understand why a low sperm count can cause male
infertility.

When the first sperm fuses with the oocyte, the oocyte deploys two
mechanisms to prevent <span data-type="term">polyspermy</span>, which is
penetration by more than one sperm. This is critical because if more
than one sperm were to fertilize the oocyte, the resulting zygote would
be a triploid organism with three sets of chromosomes. This is
incompatible with life.
{: #fs-id2158798}

The first mechanism is the fast block, which involves a near
instantaneous change in sodium ion permeability upon binding of the
first sperm, depolarizing the oocyte plasma membrane and preventing the
fusion of additional sperm cells. The fast block sets in almost
immediately and lasts for about a minute, during which time an influx of
calcium ions following sperm penetration triggers the second mechanism,
the slow block. In this process, referred to as the <span
data-type="term">cortical reaction</span>, cortical granules sitting
immediately below the oocyte plasma membrane fuse with the membrane and
release zonal inhibiting proteins and mucopolysaccharides into the space
between the plasma membrane and the zona pellucida. Zonal inhibiting
proteins cause the release of any other attached sperm and destroy the
oocyte’s sperm receptors, thus preventing any more sperm from binding.
The mucopolysaccharides then coat the nascent zygote in an impenetrable
barrier that, together with hardened zona pellucida, is called a <span
data-type="term">fertilization membrane</span>.

# The Zygote
{: data-type="title"}

Recall that at the point of fertilization, the oocyte has not yet
completed meiosis; all secondary oocytes remain arrested in metaphase of
meiosis II until fertilization. Only upon fertilization does the oocyte
complete meiosis. The unneeded complement of genetic material that
results is stored in a second polar body that is eventually ejected. At
this moment, the oocyte has become an ovum, the female haploid gamete.
The two haploid nuclei derived from the sperm and oocyte and contained
within the egg are referred to as pronuclei. They decondense, expand,
and replicate their DNA in preparation for mitosis. The pronuclei then
migrate toward each other, their nuclear envelopes disintegrate, and the
male- and female-derived genetic material intermingles. This step
completes the process of fertilization and results in a single-celled
diploid zygote with all the genetic instructions it needs to develop
into a human.
{: #fs-id1481899}

Most of the time, a woman releases a single egg during an ovulation
cycle. However, in approximately 1 percent of ovulation cycles, two eggs
are released and both are fertilized. Two zygotes form, implant, and
develop, resulting in the birth of dizygotic (or fraternal) twins.
Because dizygotic twins develop from two eggs fertilized by two sperm,
they are no more identical than siblings born at different times.
{: #fs-id1632458}

Much less commonly, a zygote can divide into two separate offspring
during early development. This results in the birth of monozygotic (or
identical) twins. Although the zygote can split as early as the two-cell
stage, splitting occurs most commonly during the early blastocyst stage,
with roughly 70–100 cells present. These two scenarios are distinct from
each other, in that the twin embryos that separated at the two-cell
stage will have individual placentas, whereas twin embryos that form
from separation at the blastocyst stage will share a placenta and a
chorionic cavity.

<span data-type="title">In Vitro Fertilization</span> IVF, which stands
for in vitro fertilization, is an assisted reproductive technology. In
vitro, which in Latin translates to “in glass,” refers to a procedure
that takes place outside of the body. There are many different
indications for IVF. For example, a woman may produce normal eggs, but
the eggs cannot reach the uterus because the uterine tubes are blocked
or otherwise compromised. A man may have a low sperm count, low sperm
motility, sperm with an unusually high percentage of morphological
abnormalities, or sperm that are incapable of penetrating the zona
pellucida of an egg.
{: #fs-id1886730}

A typical IVF procedure begins with egg collection. A normal ovulation
cycle produces only one oocyte, but the number can be boosted
significantly (to 10–20 oocytes) by administering a short course of
gonadotropins. The course begins with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
analogs, which support the development of multiple follicles, and ends
with a luteinizing hormone (LH) analog that triggers ovulation. Right
before the ova would be released from the ovary, they are harvested
using ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval. In this procedure, ultrasound
allows a physician to visualize mature follicles. The ova are aspirated
(sucked out) using a syringe.
{: #fs-id1357225}

In parallel, sperm are obtained from the male partner or from a sperm
bank. The sperm are prepared by washing to remove seminal fluid because
seminal fluid contains a peptide, FPP (or, fertilization promoting
peptide), that—in high concentrations—prevents capacitation of the
sperm. The sperm sample is also concentrated, to increase the sperm
count per milliliter.
{: #fs-id1407878}

Next, the eggs and sperm are mixed in a petri dish. The ideal ratio is
75,000 sperm to one egg. If there are severe problems with the sperm—for
example, the count is exceedingly low, or the sperm are completely
nonmotile, or incapable of binding to or penetrating the zona
pellucida—a sperm can be injected into an egg. This is called
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
{: #fs-id2102556}

The embryos are then incubated until they either reach the eight-cell
stage or the blastocyst stage. In the United States, fertilized eggs are
typically cultured to the blastocyst stage because this results in a
higher pregnancy rate. Finally, the embryos are transferred to a woman’s
uterus using a plastic catheter (tube). [\[link\]](#fig-ch29_01_02){:

IVF is a relatively new and still evolving technology, and until
recently it was necessary to transfer multiple embryos to achieve a good
chance of a pregnancy. Today, however, transferred embryos are much more
likely to implant successfully, so countries that regulate the IVF
industry cap the number of embryos that can be transferred per cycle at
two. This reduces the risk of multiple-birth pregnancies.
{: #fs-id1887333}

The rate of success for IVF is correlated with a woman’s age. More than
40 percent of women under 35 succeed in giving birth following IVF, but
the rate drops to a little over 10 percent in women over 40.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Hundreds of millions of sperm deposited in the vagina travel toward the
oocyte, but only a few hundred actually reach it. The number of sperm
that reach the oocyte is greatly reduced because of conditions within
the female reproductive tract. Many sperm are overcome by the acidity of
the vagina, others are blocked by mucus in the cervix, whereas others
are attacked by phagocytic leukocytes in the uterus. Those sperm that do
survive undergo a change in response to those conditions. They go
through the process of capacitation, which improves their motility and
alters the membrane surrounding the acrosome, the cap-like structure in
the head of a sperm that contains the digestive enzymes needed for it to
attach to and penetrate the oocyte.
{: #fs-id2520259}

The oocyte that is released by ovulation is protected by a thick outer
layer of granulosa cells known as the corona radiata and by the zona
pellucida, a thick glycoprotein membrane that lies just outside the
oocyte’s plasma membrane. When capacitated sperm make contact with the
oocyte, they release the digestive enzymes in the acrosome (the
acrosomal reaction) and are thus able to attach to the oocyte and burrow
through to the oocyte’s zona pellucida. One of the sperm will then break
through to the oocyte’s plasma membrane and release its haploid nucleus
into the oocyte. The oocyte’s membrane structure changes in response
(cortical reaction), preventing any further penetration by another sperm
and forming a fertilization membrane. Fertilization is complete upon
unification of the haploid nuclei of the two gametes, producing a
diploid zygote.
