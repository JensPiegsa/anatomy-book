The <span data-type="term">neurological exam</span> is a clinical
assessment tool used to determine what specific parts of the CNS are
affected by damage or disease. It can be performed in a short
time—sometimes as quickly as 5 minutes—to establish neurological
function. In the emergency department, this rapid assessment can make
the difference with respect to proper treatment and the extent of
recovery that is possible.

The exam is a series of subtests separated into five major sections. The
first of these is the <span data-type="term">mental status exam</span>,
which assesses the higher cognitive functions such as memory,
orientation, and language. Then there is the <span
data-type="term">cranial nerve exam</span>, which tests the function of
the 12 cranial nerves and, therefore, the central and peripheral
structures associated with them. The cranial nerve exam tests the
sensory and motor functions of each of the nerves, as applicable. Two
major sections, the <span data-type="term">sensory exam</span> and the
<span data-type="term">motor exam</span>, test the sensory and motor
functions associated with spinal nerves. Finally, the <span
data-type="term">coordination exam</span> tests the ability to perform
complex and coordinated movements. The <span data-type="term">gait
exam</span>, which is often considered a sixth major exam, specifically
assesses the motor function of walking and can be considered part of the
coordination exam because walking is a coordinated movement.

# Neuroanatomy and the Neurological Exam
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Localization of function</span> is the concept
that circumscribed locations are responsible for specific functions. The
neurological exam highlights this relationship. For example, the
cognitive functions that are assessed in the mental status exam are
based on functions in the cerebrum, mostly in the cerebral cortex.
Several of the subtests examine language function. Deficits in
neurological function uncovered by these examinations usually point to
damage to the left cerebral cortex. In the majority of individuals,
language function is localized to the left hemisphere between the
superior temporal lobe and the posterior frontal lobe, including the
intervening connections through the inferior parietal lobe.
{: #fs-id2595084}

The five major sections of the neurological exam are related to the
major regions of the CNS ([\[link\]](#fig-ch16_01_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). The mental status exam assesses functions
related to the cerebrum. The cranial nerve exam is for the nerves that
connect to the diencephalon and brain stem (as well as the olfactory
connections to the forebrain). The coordination exam and the related
gait exam primarily assess the functions of the cerebellum. The motor
and sensory exams are associated with the spinal cord and its
connections through the spinal nerves.

</figure>
Part of the power of the neurological exam is this link between
structure and function. Testing the various functions represented in the
exam allows an accurate estimation of where the nervous system may be
damaged. Consider the patient described in the chapter introduction. In
the emergency department, he is given a quick exam to find where the
deficit may be localized. Knowledge of where the damage occurred will
lead to the most effective therapy.
{: #fs-id2147627}

In rapid succession, he is asked to smile, raise his eyebrows, stick out
his tongue, and shrug his shoulders. The doctor tests muscular strength
by providing resistance against his arms and legs while he tries to lift
them. With his eyes closed, he has to indicate when he feels the tip of
a pen touch his legs, arms, fingers, and face. He follows the tip of a
pen as the doctor moves it through the visual field and finally toward
his face. A formal mental status exam is not needed at this point; the
patient will demonstrate any possible deficits in that area during
normal interactions with the interviewer. If cognitive or language
deficits are apparent, the interviewer can pursue mental status in more
depth. All of this takes place in less than 5 minutes. The patient
reports that he feels pins and needles in his left arm and leg, and has
trouble feeling the tip of the pen when he is touched on those limbs.
This suggests a problem with the sensory systems between the spinal cord
and the brain. The emergency department has a lead to follow before a CT
scan is performed. He is put on aspirin therapy to limit the possibility
of blood clots forming, in case the cause is an <span
data-type="term">embolus</span>—an obstruction such as a blood clot that
blocks the flow of blood in an artery or vein.

# Causes of Neurological Deficits
{: data-type="title"}

Damage to the nervous system can be limited to individual structures or
can be distributed across broad areas of the brain and spinal cord.
Localized, limited injury to the nervous system is most often the result
of circulatory problems. Neurons are very sensitive to oxygen
deprivation and will start to deteriorate within 1 or 2 minutes, and
permanent damage (cell death) could result within a few hours. The loss
of blood flow to part of the brain is known as a <span
data-type="term">stroke</span>, or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
{: #fs-id1645044}

There are two main types of stroke, depending on how the blood supply is
compromised: ischemic and hemorrhagic. An <span
data-type="term">ischemic stroke</span> is the loss of blood flow to an
area because vessels are blocked or narrowed. This is often caused by an
embolus, which may be a blood clot or fat deposit. Ischemia may also be
the result of thickening of the blood vessel wall, or a drop in blood
volume in the brain known as <span data-type="term">hypovolemia</span>.
{: #fs-id1571384}

A related type of CVA is known as a <span data-type="term">transient
ischemic attack (TIA)</span>, which is similar to a stroke although it
does not last as long. The diagnostic definition of a stroke includes
effects that last at least 24 hours. Any stroke symptoms that are
resolved within a 24-hour period because of restoration of adequate
blood flow are classified as a TIA.
{: #fs-id2520527}

A <span data-type="term">hemorrhagic stroke</span> is bleeding into the
brain because of a damaged blood vessel. Accumulated blood fills a
region of the cranial vault and presses against the tissue in the brain
([\[link\]](#fig-ch16_01_02){: .autogenerated-content}). Physical
pressure on the brain can cause the loss of function, as well as the
squeezing of local arteries resulting in compromised blood flow beyond
the site of the hemorrhage. As blood pools in the nervous tissue and the
vasculature is damaged, the blood-brain barrier can break down and allow
additional fluid to accumulate in the region, which is known as <span
data-type="term">edema</span>.

</figure>
Whereas hemorrhagic stroke may involve bleeding into a large region of
the CNS, such as into the deep white matter of a cerebral hemisphere,
other events can cause widespread damage and loss of neurological
functions. Infectious diseases can lead to loss of function throughout
the CNS as components of nervous tissue, specifically astrocytes and
microglia, react to the disease. Blunt force trauma, such as from a
motor vehicle accident, can physically damage the CNS.
{: #fs-id1617735}

A class of disorders that affect the nervous system are the
neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,
Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
Creutzfeld–Jacob disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), and other disorders
that are the result of nervous tissue degeneration. In diseases like
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or ALS, neurons die; in diseases like MS,
myelin is affected. Some of these disorders affect motor function, and
others present with dementia. How patients with these disorders perform
in the neurological exam varies, but is often broad in its effects, such
as memory deficits that compromise many aspects of the mental status
exam, or movement deficits that compromise aspects of the cranial nerve
exam, the motor exam, or the coordination exam. The causes of these
disorders are also varied. Some are the result of genetics, such as
Huntington’s disease, or the result of autoimmunity, such as MS; others
are not entirely understood, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
diseases. Current research suggests that many of these diseases are
related in how the degeneration takes place and may be treated by common
therapies.
{: #fs-id2242361}

Finally, a common cause of neurological changes is observed in
developmental disorders. Whether the result of genetic factors or the
environment during development, there are certain situations that result
in neurological functions being different from the expected norms.
Developmental disorders are difficult to define because they are caused
by defects that existed in the past and disrupted the normal development
of the CNS. These defects probably involve multiple environmental and
genetic factors—most of the time, we don’t know what the cause is other
than that it is more complex than just one factor. Furthermore, each
defect on its own may not be a problem, but when several are added
together, they can disrupt growth processes that are not well understand
in the first place. For instance, it is possible for a stroke to damage
a specific region of the brain and lead to the loss of the ability to
recognize faces (prosopagnosia). The link between cell death in the
fusiform gyrus and the symptom is relatively easy to understand. In
contrast, similar deficits can be seen in children with the
developmental disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, these
children do not lack a fusiform gyrus, nor is there any damage or defect
visible to this brain region. We conclude, rather poorly, that this
brain region is not connected properly to other brain regions.
{: #fs-id2170668}

Infection, trauma, and congenital disorders can all lead to significant
signs, as identified through the neurological exam. It is important to
differentiate between an acute event, such as stroke, and a chronic or
global condition such as blunt force trauma. Responses seen in the
neurological exam can help. A loss of language function observed in all
its aspects is more likely a global event as opposed to a discrete loss
of one function, such as not being able to say certain types of words. A
concern, however, is that a specific function—such as controlling the
muscles of speech—may mask other language functions. The various
subtests within the mental status exam can address these finer points
and help clarify the underlying cause of the neurological loss.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The neurological exam is a clinical assessment tool to determine the
extent of function from the nervous system. It is divided into five
major sections that each deal with a specific region of the CNS. The
mental status exam is concerned with the cerebrum and assesses higher
functions such as memory, language, and emotion. The cranial nerve exam
tests the functions of all of the cranial nerves and, therefore, their
connections to the CNS through the forebrain and brain stem. The sensory
and motor exams assess those functions as they relate to the spinal
cord, as well as the combination of the functions in spinal reflexes.
The coordination exam targets cerebellar function in coordinated
movements, including those functions associated with gait.
{: #fs-id1393639}

Damage to and disease of the nervous system lead to loss of function.
The location of the injury will correspond to the functional loss, as
suggested by the principle of localization of function. The neurological
exam provides the opportunity for a clinician to determine where damage
has occurred on the basis of the function that is lost. Damage from
acute injuries such as strokes may result in specific functions being
lost, whereas broader effects in infection or developmental disorders
may result in general losses across an entire section of the
neurological exam.
