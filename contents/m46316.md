As you will recall, a developing human is called a fetus from the ninth
week of gestation until birth. This 30-week period of development is
marked by continued cell growth and differentiation, which fully develop
the structures and functions of the immature organ systems formed during
the embryonic period. The completion of fetal development results in a
newborn who, although still immature in many ways, is capable of
survival outside the womb.

# Sexual Differentiation
{: data-type="title"}

Sexual differentiation does not begin until the fetal period, during
weeks 9–12. Embryonic males and females, though genetically
distinguishable, are morphologically identical
([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_03_01){: .autogenerated-content}). Bipotential
gonads, or gonads that can develop into male or female sexual organs,
are connected to a central cavity called the cloaca via Müllerian ducts
and Wolffian ducts. (The cloaca is an extension of the primitive gut.)
Several events lead to sexual differentiation during this period.
{: #fs-id1725244}

During male fetal development, the bipotential gonads become the testes
and associated epididymis. The Müllerian ducts degenerate. The Wolffian
ducts become the vas deferens, and the cloaca becomes the urethra and
rectum.
{: #fs-id2686721}

During female fetal development, the bipotential gonads develop into
ovaries. The Wolffian ducts degenerate. The Müllerian ducts become the
uterine tubes and uterus, and the cloaca divides and develops into a
vagina, a urethra, and a rectum.

# The Fetal Circulatory System
{: data-type="title"}

During prenatal development, the fetal circulatory system is integrated
with the placenta via the umbilical cord so that the fetus receives both
oxygen and nutrients from the placenta. However, after childbirth, the
umbilical cord is severed, and the newborn’s circulatory system must be
reconfigured. When the heart first forms in the embryo, it exists as two
parallel tubes derived from mesoderm and lined with endothelium, which
then fuse together. As the embryo develops into a fetus, the tube-shaped
heart folds and further differentiates into the four chambers present in
a mature heart. Unlike a mature cardiovascular system, however, the
fetal cardiovascular system also includes circulatory shortcuts, or
shunts. A <span data-type="term">shunt</span> is an anatomical (or
sometimes surgical) diversion that allows blood flow to bypass immature
organs such as the lungs and liver until childbirth.
{: #fs-id2200871}

The placenta provides the fetus with necessary oxygen and nutrients via
the umbilical vein. (Remember that veins carry blood toward the heart.
In this case, the blood flowing to the fetal heart is oxygenated because
it comes from the placenta. The respiratory system is immature and
cannot yet oxygenate blood on its own.) From the umbilical vein, the
oxygenated blood flows toward the inferior vena cava, all but bypassing
the immature liver, via the <span data-type="term">ductus venosus</span>
shunt ([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_03_02){: .autogenerated-content}). The liver
receives just a trickle of blood, which is all that it needs in its
immature, semifunctional state. Blood flows from the inferior vena cava
to the right atrium, mixing with fetal venous blood along the way.
{: #fs-id1339991}

Although the fetal liver is semifunctional, the fetal lungs are
nonfunctional. The fetal circulation therefore bypasses the lungs by
shifting some of the blood through the <span data-type="term">foramen
ovale</span>, a shunt that directly connects the right and left atria
and avoids the pulmonary trunk altogether. Most of the rest of the blood
is pumped to the right ventricle, and from there, into the pulmonary
trunk, which splits into pulmonary arteries. However, a shunt within the
pulmonary artery, the <span data-type="term">ductus arteriosus</span>,
diverts a portion of this blood into the aorta. This ensures that only a
small volume of oxygenated blood passes through the immature pulmonary
circuit, which has only minor metabolic requirements. Blood vessels of
uninflated lungs have high resistance to flow, a condition that
encourages blood to flow to the aorta, which presents much lower
resistance. The oxygenated blood moves through the foramen ovale into
the left atrium, where it mixes with the now deoxygenated blood
returning from the pulmonary circuit. This blood then moves into the
left ventricle, where it is pumped into the aorta. Some of this blood
moves through the coronary arteries into the myocardium, and some moves
through the carotid arteries to the brain.
{: #fs-id2306652}

The descending aorta carries partially oxygenated and partially
deoxygenated blood into the lower regions of the body. It eventually
passes into the umbilical arteries through branches of the internal
iliac arteries. The deoxygenated blood collects waste as it circulates
through the fetal body and returns to the umbilical cord. Thus, the two
umbilical arteries carry blood low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide
and fetal wastes. This blood is filtered through the placenta, where
wastes diffuse into the maternal circulation. Oxygen and nutrients from
the mother diffuse into the placenta and from there into the fetal
blood, and the process repeats.

# Other Organ Systems
{: data-type="title"}

During weeks 9–12 of fetal development, the brain continues to expand,
the body elongates, and ossification continues. Fetal movements are
frequent during this period, but are jerky and not well-controlled. The
bone marrow begins to take over the process of erythrocyte production—a
task that the liver performed during the embryonic period. The liver now
secretes bile. The fetus circulates amniotic fluid by swallowing it and
producing urine. The eyes are well-developed by this stage, but the
eyelids are fused shut. The fingers and toes begin to develop nails. By
the end of week 12, the fetus measures approximately 9 cm (3.5 in) from
crown to rump.
{: #fs-id2308410}

Weeks 13–16 are marked by sensory organ development. The eyes move
closer together; blinking motions begin, although the eyes remain sealed
shut. The lips exhibit sucking motions. The ears move upward and lie
flatter against the head. The scalp begins to grow hair. The excretory
system is also developing: the kidneys are well-formed, and <span
data-type="term">meconium</span>, or fetal feces, begins to accumulate
in the intestines. Meconium consists of ingested amniotic fluid,
cellular debris, mucus, and bile.
{: #fs-id1917800}

During approximately weeks 16–20, as the fetus grows and limb movements
become more powerful, the mother may begin to feel <span
data-type="term">quickening</span>, or fetal movements. However, space
restrictions limit these movements and typically force the growing fetus
into the “fetal position,” with the arms crossed and the legs bent at
the knees. Sebaceous glands coat the skin with a waxy, protective
substance called <span data-type="term">vernix caseosa</span> that
protects and moisturizes the skin and may provide lubrication during
childbirth. A silky hair called <span data-type="term">lanugo</span>
also covers the skin during weeks 17–20, but it is shed as the fetus
continues to grow. Extremely premature infants sometimes exhibit
residual lanugo.
{: #fs-id1525740}

Developmental weeks 21–30 are characterized by rapid weight gain, which
is important for maintaining a stable body temperature after birth. The
bone marrow completely takes over erythrocyte synthesis, and the axons
of the spinal cord begin to be myelinated, or coated in the electrically
insulating glial cell sheaths that are necessary for efficient nervous
system functioning. (The process of myelination is not completed until
adolescence.) During this period, the fetus grows eyelashes. The eyelids
are no longer fused and can be opened and closed. The lungs begin
producing surfactant, a substance that reduces surface tension in the
lungs and assists proper lung expansion after birth. Inadequate
surfactant production in premature newborns may result in respiratory
distress syndrome, and as a result, the newborn may require surfactant
replacement therapy, supplemental oxygen, or maintenance in a continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP) chamber during their first days or weeks
of life. In male fetuses, the testes descend into the scrotum near the
end of this period. The fetus at 30 weeks measures 28 cm (11 in) from
crown to rump and exhibits the approximate body proportions of a
full-term newborn, but still is much leaner.

The fetus continues to lay down subcutaneous fat from week 31 until
birth. The added fat fills out the hypodermis, and the skin transitions
from red and wrinkled to soft and pink. Lanugo is shed, and the nails
grow to the tips of the fingers and toes. Immediately before birth, the
average crown-to-rump length is 35.5–40.5 cm (14–16 in), and the fetus
weighs approximately 2.5–4 kg (5.5–8.8 lbs). Once born, the newborn is
no longer confined to the fetal position, so subsequent measurements are
made from head-to-toe instead of from crown-to-rump. At birth, the
average length is approximately 51 cm (20 in).

Disorders of the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Developing Fetus</span> Throughout the second
half of gestation, the fetal intestines accumulate a tarry, greenish
black meconium. The newborn’s first stools consist almost entirely of
meconium; they later transition to seedy yellow stools or slightly
formed tan stools as meconium is cleared and replaced with digested
breast milk or formula, respectively. Unlike these later stools,
meconium is sterile; it is devoid of bacteria because the fetus is in a
sterile environment and has not consumed any breast milk or formula.
Typically, an infant does not pass meconium until after birth. However,
in 5–20 percent of births, the fetus has a bowel movement in utero,
which can cause major complications in the newborn.
{: #fs-id1887333}

The passage of meconium in the uterus signals fetal distress,
particularly fetal hypoxia (i.e., oxygen deprivation). This may be
caused by maternal drug abuse (especially tobacco or cocaine), maternal
hypertension, depletion of amniotic fluid, long labor or difficult
birth, or a defect in the placenta that prevents it from delivering
adequate oxygen to the fetus. Meconium passage is typically a
complication of full-term or post-term newborns because it is rarely
passed before 34 weeks of gestation, when the gastrointestinal system
has matured and is appropriately controlled by nervous system stimuli.
Fetal distress can stimulate the vagus nerve to trigger gastrointestinal
peristalsis and relaxation of the anal sphincter. Notably, fetal hypoxic
stress also induces a gasping reflex, increasing the likelihood that
meconium will be inhaled into the fetal lungs.
{: #fs-id2162548}

Although meconium is a sterile substance, it interferes with the
antibiotic properties of the amniotic fluid and makes the newborn and
mother more vulnerable to bacterial infections at birth and during the
perinatal period. Specifically, inflammation of the fetal membranes,
inflammation of the uterine lining, or neonatal sepsis (infection in the
newborn) may occur. Meconium also irritates delicate fetal skin and can
cause a rash.
{: #fs-id1394791}

The first sign that a fetus has passed meconium usually does not come
until childbirth, when the amniotic sac ruptures. Normal amniotic fluid
is clear and watery, but amniotic fluid in which meconium has been
passed is stained greenish or yellowish. Antibiotics given to the mother
may reduce the incidence of maternal bacterial infections, but it is
critical that meconium is aspirated from the newborn before the first
breath. Under these conditions, an obstetrician will extensively
aspirate the infant’s airways as soon as the head is delivered, while
the rest of the infant’s body is still inside the birth canal.
{: #fs-id1521074}

Aspiration of meconium with the first breath can result in labored
breathing, a barrel-shaped chest, or a low Apgar score. An obstetrician
can identify meconium aspiration by listening to the lungs with a
stethoscope for a coarse rattling sound. Blood gas tests and chest
X-rays of the infant can confirm meconium aspiration. Inhaled meconium
after birth could obstruct a newborn’s airways leading to alveolar
collapse, interfere with surfactant function by stripping it from the
lungs, or cause pulmonary inflammation or hypertension. Any of these
complications will make the newborn much more vulnerable to pulmonary
infection, including pneumonia.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The fetal period lasts from the ninth week of development until birth.
During this period, male and female gonads differentiate. The fetal
circulatory system becomes much more specialized and efficient than its
embryonic counterpart. It includes three shunts—the ductus venosus, the
foramen ovale, and the ductus arteriosus—that enable it to bypass the
semifunctional liver and pulmonary circuit until after childbirth. The
brain continues to grow and its structures differentiate. Facial
features develop, the body elongates, and the skeleton ossifies. In the
womb, the developing fetus moves, blinks, practices sucking, and
circulates amniotic fluid. The fetus grows from an embryo measuring
approximately 3.3 cm (1.3 in) and weighing 7 g (0.25 oz) to an infant
measuring approximately 51 cm (20 in) and weighing an average of
approximately 3.4 kg (7.5 lbs). Embryonic organ structures that were
primitive and nonfunctional develop to the point that the newborn can
survive in the outside world.
