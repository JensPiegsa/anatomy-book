Chapter Objectives
</div>
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* List and describe the functions of bones
* Describe the classes of bones
* Discuss the process of bone formation and development
* Explain how bone repairs itself after a fracture
* Discuss the effect of exercise, nutrition, and hormones on bone tissue
* Describe how an imbalance of calcium can affect bone tissue

</div>

Bones make good fossils. While the soft tissue of a once living organism will decay and fall away over time, bone tissue will, under the right conditions, undergo a process of mineralization, effectively turning the bone to stone. A well-preserved fossil skeleton can give us a good sense of the size and shape of an organism, just as your skeleton helps to define your size and shape. Unlike a fossil skeleton, however, your skeleton is a structure of living tissue that grows, repairs, and renews itself. The bones within it are dynamic and complex organs that serve a number of important functions, including some necessary to maintain homeostasis.
