Child Looking at Bones

<figcaption>
Bone is a living tissue. Unlike the bones of a fossil made inert by a
process of mineralization, a childâ€™s bones will continue to grow and
develop while contributing to the support and function of other body
systems. (credit: James Emery)

{: #eip-id1167676278241}

* List and describe the functions of bones
* Describe the classes of bones
* Discuss the process of bone formation and development
* Explain how bone repairs itself after a fracture
* Discuss the effect of exercise, nutrition, and hormones on bone tissue
* Describe how an imbalance of calcium can affect bone tissue

Bones make good fossils. While the soft tissue of a once living organism
will decay and fall away over time, bone tissue will, under the right
conditions, undergo a process of mineralization, effectively turning the
bone to stone. A well-preserved fossil skeleton can give us a good sense
of the size and shape of an organism, just as your skeleton helps to
define your size and shape. Unlike a fossil skeleton, however, your
skeleton is a structure of living tissue that grows, repairs, and renews
itself. The bones within it are dynamic and complex organs that serve a
number of important functions, including some necessary to maintain
homeostasis.
