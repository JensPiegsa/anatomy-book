Single-celled organisms do not need blood. They obtain nutrients
directly from and excrete wastes directly into their environment. The
human organism cannot do that. Our large, complex bodies need blood to
deliver nutrients to and remove wastes from our trillions of cells. The
heart pumps blood throughout the body in a network of blood vessels.
Together, these three components—blood, heart, and vessels—makes up the
cardiovascular system. This chapter focuses on the medium of transport:
blood.
