Atoms separated by a great distance cannot link; rather, they must come
close enough for the electrons in their valence shells to interact. But
do atoms ever actually touch one another? Most physicists would say no,
because the negatively charged electrons in their valence shells repel
one another. No force within the human body—or anywhere in the natural
world—is strong enough to overcome this electrical repulsion. So when
you read about atoms linking together or colliding, bear in mind that
the atoms are not merging in a physical sense.
{: #fs-id2372961}

Instead, atoms link by forming a chemical bond. A <span
data-type="term">bond</span> is a weak or strong electrical attraction
that holds atoms in the same vicinity. The new grouping is typically
more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms were
when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more
atoms held together by chemical bonds is called a <span
data-type="term">molecule</span>. The bonded atoms may be of the same
element, as in the case of H<sub>2</sub>, which is called molecular
hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more
atoms of different elements, it is called a chemical <span
data-type="term">compound</span>. Thus, a unit of water, or
H<sub>2</sub>O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas
methane, or CH<sub>4</sub>.
{: #fs-id1493624}

Three types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because
they hold together substances that are used by the body for critical
aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a
few important processes. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and
hydrogen bonds.

Recall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged
protons and negatively charged electrons. As long as this situation
remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates
in a chemical reaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one
or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or negatively
charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full
valence shell, as described previously. This can happen either by
gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by
giving away electrons to empty a shell than is less than half-full,
thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full,
valence shell. An atom that has an electrical charge—whether positive or
negative—is an <span data-type="term">ion</span>.

Potassium (K), for instance, is an important element in all body cells.
Its atomic number is 19. It has just one electron in its valence shell.
This characteristic makes potassium highly likely to participate in
chemical reactions in which it donates one electron. (It is easier for
potassium to donate one electron than to gain seven electrons.) The loss
will cause the positive charge of potassium’s protons to be more
influential than the negative charge of potassium’s electrons. In other
words, the resulting potassium ion will be slightly positive. A
potassium ion is written K<sup>+</sup>, indicating that it has lost a
single electron. A positively charged ion is known as a <span
data-type="term">cation</span>.
{: #fs-id2579813}

Now consider fluorine (F), a component of bones and teeth. Its atomic
number is nine, and it has seven electrons in its valence shell. Thus,
it is highly likely to bond with other atoms in such a way that fluorine
accepts one electron (it is easier for fluorine to gain one electron
than to donate seven electrons). When it does, its electrons will
outnumber its protons by one, and it will have an overall negative
charge. The ionized form of fluorine is called fluoride, and is written
as F<sup>–</sup>. A negatively charged ion is known as an <span
data-type="term">anion</span>.
{: #fs-id2158913}

Atoms that have more than one electron to donate or accept will end up
with stronger positive or negative charges. A cation that has donated
two electrons has a net charge of +2. Using magnesium (Mg) as an
example, this can be written Mg<sup>++</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. An
anion that has accepted two electrons has a net charge of –2. The ionic
form of selenium (Se), for example, is typically written
Se<sup>2–</sup>.
{: #fs-id1405066}

The opposite charges of cations and anions exert a moderately strong
mutual attraction that keeps the atoms in close proximity forming an
ionic bond. An <span data-type="term">ionic bond</span> is an ongoing,
close association between ions of opposite charge. The table salt you
sprinkle on your food owes its existence to ionic bonding. As shown in
[\[link\]](#fig-ch02_02_01){: .autogenerated-content}, sodium commonly
donates an electron to chlorine, becoming the cation Na<sup>+</sup>.
When chlorine accepts the electron, it becomes the chloride anion,
Cl<sup>–</sup>. With their opposing charges, these two ions strongly
attract each other.

Water is an essential component of life because it is able to break the
ionic bonds in salts to free the ions. In fact, in biological fluids,
most individual atoms exist as ions. These dissolved ions produce
electrical charges within the body. The behavior of these ions produces
the tracings of heart and brain function observed as waves on an
electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) or an electroencephalogram (EEG). The
electrical activity that derives from the interactions of the charged
ions is why they are also called electrolytes.

# Covalent Bonds
{: data-type="title"}

Unlike ionic bonds formed by the attraction between a cation’s positive
charge and an anion’s negative charge, molecules formed by a <span
data-type="term">covalent bond</span> share electrons in a mutually
stabilizing relationship. Like next-door neighbors whose kids hang out
first at one home and then at the other, the atoms do not lose or gain
electrons permanently. Instead, the electrons move back and forth
between the elements. Because of the close sharing of pairs of electrons
(one electron from each of two atoms), covalent bonds are stronger than
ionic bonds.

## Nonpolar Covalent Bonds
{: data-type="title"}

[\[link\]](#fig-ch02_02_02){: .autogenerated-content} shows several
common types of covalent bonds. Notice that the two covalently bonded
atoms typically share just one or two electron pairs, though larger
sharings are possible. The important concept to take from this is that
in covalent bonds, electrons in the outermost valence shell are shared
to fill the valence shells of both atoms, ultimately stabilizing both of
the atoms involved. In a single covalent bond, a single electron is
shared between two atoms, while in a double covalent bond, two pairs of
electrons are shared between two atoms. There even are triple covalent
bonds, where three atoms are shared.

</figure>
You can see that the covalent bonds shown in
[\[link\]](#fig-ch02_02_02){: .autogenerated-content} are balanced. The
sharing of the negative electrons is relatively equal, as is the
electrical pull of the positive protons in the nucleus of the atoms
involved. This is why covalently bonded molecules that are electrically
balanced in this way are described as nonpolar; that is, no region of
the molecule is either more positive or more negative than any other.

## Polar Covalent Bonds
{: data-type="title"}

Groups of legislators with completely opposite views on a particular
issue are often described as “polarized” by news writers. In chemistry,
a <span data-type="term">polar molecule</span> is a molecule that
contains regions that have opposite electrical charges. Polar molecules
occur when atoms share electrons unequally, in polar covalent bonds.
{: #fs-id1909147}

The most familiar example of a polar molecule is water
([\[link\]](#fig-ch02_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}). The molecule
has three parts: one atom of oxygen, the nucleus of which contains eight
protons, and two hydrogen atoms, whose nuclei each contain only one
proton. Because every proton exerts an identical positive charge, a
nucleus that contains eight protons exerts a charge eight times greater
than a nucleus that contains one proton. This means that the negatively
charged electrons present in the water molecule are more strongly
attracted to the oxygen nucleus than to the hydrogen nuclei. Each
hydrogen atom’s single negative electron therefore migrates toward the
oxygen atom, making the oxygen end of their bond slightly more negative
than the hydrogen end of their bond.

data-media-type="image/jpg" width="380"} </span>
</figure>
What is true for the bonds is true for the water molecule as a whole;
that is, the oxygen region has a slightly negative charge and the
regions of the hydrogen atoms have a slightly positive charge. These
charges are often referred to as “partial charges” because the strength
of the charge is less than one full electron, as would occur in an ionic
bond. As shown in [\[link\]](#fig-ch02_02_03){: .autogenerated-content},
regions of weak polarity are indicated with the Greek letter delta (∂)
and a plus (+) or minus (–) sign.
{: #fs-id2030665}

Even though a single water molecule is unimaginably tiny, it has mass,
and the opposing electrical charges on the molecule pull that mass in
such a way that it creates a shape somewhat like a triangular tent (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch02_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}**b**{:
data-effect="bold"}). This dipole, with the positive charges at one end
formed by the hydrogen atoms at the “bottom” of the tent and the
negative charge at the opposite end (the oxygen atom at the “top” of the
tent) makes the charged regions highly likely to interact with charged
regions of other polar molecules. For human physiology, the resulting
bond is one of the most important formed by water—the hydrogen bond.

# Hydrogen Bonds
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">hydrogen bond</span> is formed when a weakly
positive hydrogen atom already bonded to one electronegative atom (for
example, the oxygen in the water molecule) is attracted to another
electronegative atom from another molecule. In other words, hydrogen
bonds always include hydrogen that is already part of a polar molecule.
{: #fs-id1411843}

The most common example of hydrogen bonding in the natural world occurs
between molecules of water. It happens before your eyes whenever two
raindrops merge into a larger bead, or a creek spills into a river.
Hydrogen bonding occurs because the weakly negative oxygen atom in one
water molecule is attracted to the weakly positive hydrogen atoms of two
other water molecules ([\[link\]](#fig-ch02_02_04){:
.autogenerated-content}).

Hydrogen Bonds between Water Molecules
</div>

Notice that the bonds occur between the weakly positive charge on the
hydrogen atoms and the weakly negative charge on the oxygen atoms.
Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, and therefore are indicated with a
dotted (rather than a solid) line.

</figure>
Water molecules also strongly attract other types of charged molecules
as well as ions. This explains why “table salt,” for example, actually
is a molecule called a “salt” in chemistry, which consists of equal
numbers of positively-charged sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and
negatively-charged chloride (Cl<sup>–</sup>), dissolves so readily in
water, in this case forming dipole-ion bonds between the water and the
electrically-charged ions (electrolytes). Water molecules also repel
molecules with nonpolar covalent bonds, like fats, lipids, and oils. You
can demonstrate this with a simple kitchen experiment: pour a teaspoon
of vegetable oil, a compound formed by nonpolar covalent bonds, into a
glass of water. Instead of instantly dissolving in the water, the oil
forms a distinct bead because the polar water molecules repel the
nonpolar oil.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Each moment of life, atoms of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and the other
elements of the human body are making and breaking chemical bonds. Ions
are charged atoms that form when an atom donates or accepts one or more
negatively charged electrons. Cations (ions with a positive charge) are
attracted to anions (ions with a negative charge). This attraction is
called an ionic bond. In covalent bonds, the participating atoms do not
lose or gain electrons, but rather share them. Molecules with nonpolar
covalent bonds are electrically balanced, and have a linear
three-dimensional shape. Molecules with polar covalent bonds have
“poles”—regions of weakly positive and negative charge—and have a
triangular three-dimensional shape. An atom of oxygen and two atoms of
hydrogen form water molecules by means of polar covalent bonds. Hydrogen
bonds link hydrogen atoms already participating in polar covalent bonds
to anions or electronegative regions of other polar molecules. Hydrogen
bonds link water molecules, resulting in the properties of water that
are important to living things.
