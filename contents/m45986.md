title: Functions of Human Life
layout: page

<div data-type="abstract" markdown="1">
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Explain the importance of organization to the function of the human
  organism
* Distinguish between metabolism, anabolism, and catabolism
* Provide at least two examples of human responsiveness and human
  movement
* Compare and contrast growth, differentiation, and reproduction

</div>
The different organ systems each have different functions and therefore
unique roles to perform in physiology. These many functions can be
summarized in terms of a few that we might consider definitive of human
life: organization, metabolism, responsiveness, movement, development,
and reproduction.

# Organization
{: data-type="title"}

A human body consists of trillions of cells organized in a way that
maintains distinct internal compartments. These compartments keep body
cells separated from external environmental threats and keep the cells
moist and nourished. They also separate internal body fluids from the
countless microorganisms that grow on body surfaces, including the
lining of certain tracts, or passageways. The intestinal tract, for
example, is home to even more bacteria cells than the total of all human
cells in the body, yet these bacteria are outside the body and cannot be
allowed to circulate freely inside the body.
{: #fs-id1371870}

Cells, for example, have a cell membrane (also referred to as the plasma
membrane) that keeps the intracellular environment—the fluids and
organelles—separate from the extracellular environment. Blood vessels
keep blood inside a closed circulatory system, and nerves and muscles
are wrapped in connective tissue sheaths that separate them from
surrounding structures. In the chest and abdomen, a variety of internal
membranes keep major organs such as the lungs, heart, and kidneys
separate from others.
{: #fs-id2352225}

The body’s largest organ system is the integumentary system, which
includes the skin and its associated structures, such as hair and nails.
The surface tissue of skin is a barrier that protects internal
structures and fluids from potentially harmful microorganisms and other
toxins.

# Energy Transfer and Metabolism
{: data-type="title"}

The first law of thermodynamics holds that energy can neither be created
nor destroyed—it can only change form. Your basic function as an
organism is to consume (ingest) energy and molecules in the foods you
eat, convert some of it into fuel for movement, sustain your body
functions, and build and maintain your body structures. There are two
types of reactions that accomplish this: anabolism and catabolism
{: #fs-id2514677}

* <span data-type="term">Anabolism</span> is the process whereby
  smaller, simpler molecules are combined into larger, more complex
  substances. Your body can assemble, by utilizing energy, the complex
  chemicals it needs by combining small molecules derived from the foods
  you eat
* <span data-type="term">Catabolism</span> is the process by which
  larger more complex substances are broken down into smaller simpler
  molecules. Catabolism releases energy. The complex molecules found in
  foods are broken down so the body can use their parts to assemble the
  structures and substances needed for life.
{: #fs-id2970538}

Taken together, these two processes are called metabolism. <span
data-type="term">Metabolism</span> is the sum of all anabolic and
catabolic reactions that take place in the body
([\[link\]](#fig-ch01_03_01){: .autogenerated-content}). Both anabolism
and catabolism occur simultaneously and continuously to keep you alive.

</figure>
Every cell in your body makes use of a chemical compound, adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), to store and release energy. The cell stores energy
in the synthesis (anabolism) of ATP, then moves the ATP molecules to the
location where energy is needed to fuel cellular activities. Then the
ATP is broken down (catabolism) and a controlled amount of energy is
released, which is used by the cell to perform a particular job.

# Responsiveness
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Responsiveness</span> is the ability of an
organism to adjust to changes in its internal and external environments.
An example of responsiveness to external stimuli could include moving
toward sources of food and water and away from perceived dangers.
Changes in an organism’s internal environment, such as increased body
temperature, can cause the responses of sweating and the dilation of
blood vessels in the skin in order to decrease body temperature, as
shown by the runners in [\[link\]](#fig-ch01_03_02){:
.autogenerated-content}.

# Movement
{: data-type="title"}

Human movement includes not only actions at the joints of the body, but
also the motion of individual organs and even individual cells. As you
read these words, red and white blood cells are moving throughout your
body, muscle cells are contracting and relaxing to maintain your posture
and to focus your vision, and glands are secreting chemicals to regulate
body functions. Your body is coordinating the action of entire muscle
groups to enable you to move air into and out of your lungs, to push
blood throughout your body, and to propel the food you have eaten
through your digestive tract. Consciously, of course, you contract your
skeletal muscles to move the bones of your skeleton to get from one
place to another (as the runners are doing in
[\[link\]](#fig-ch01_03_02){: .autogenerated-content}), and to carry out
all of the activities of your daily life.

# Development
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Development</span> is all of the changes the body
goes through in life. Development includes the processes of
differentiation, growth, and renewal.
{: #fs-id2305104}

<span data-type="term">Differentiation</span> is the process whereby
unspecialized cells become specialized in both structure and function.
After conception, when a female’s egg cell is fertilized by a male’s
sperm cell, the fertilized egg begins to multiply, initially into a
cluster of identical unspecialized cells. As cell division continues,
however, the cells begin to undergo differentiation into distinct tissue
layers, and eventually into all of the specialized cells, tissues, and
organs of the fetus. The progression from the undifferentiated cells to
certain types of differentiated cells goes on throughout life, even in
the bodies of adults.
{: #fs-id1423628}

<span data-type="term">Growth</span> is the increase in body size.
Humans, like all multicellular organisms, grow by increasing the number
of existing cells, increasing the amount of non-cellular material around
cells (such as mineral deposits in bone), and, within very narrow
limits, increasing the size of existing cells.
{: #fs-id596804}

<span data-type="term">Renewal</span> is the formation of new cells for
growth, repair, or replacement. In some organ systems, such as the
digestive system, worn-out cells are constantly replaced throughout
life. Some other specialized cells, however, have only a limited
capacity for renewal. This is true, for example, of nerve cells of the
nervous system. When death of such cells is extensive (as can occur in a
stroke, which causes cell death in the brain), the system can fail.
Because the body is an integrated whole, failure of a body system can
ultimately lead to the death of the organism.
{: #fs-id2531464}

<span data-type="term">Reproduction</span> is the formation of a new
organism from parent organisms. In humans, reproduction is carried out
by the male and female reproductive systems. Because death will come to
all complex organisms, without reproduction, the line of organisms would
end.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Most processes that occur in the human body are not consciously
controlled. They occur continuously to build, maintain, and sustain
life. These processes include: organization, in terms of the maintenance
of essential body boundaries; metabolism, including energy transfer via
anabolic and catabolic reactions; responsiveness; movement; and growth,
differentiation, reproduction, and renewal.

When you are sitting at a campfire, your sense of smell adapts to the
smell of smoke. Only if that smell were to suddenly and dramatically
intensify would you be likely to notice and respond. In contrast, the
smell of even a trace of smoke would be new and highly unusual in your
