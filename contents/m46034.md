So far in this chapter, you have read numerous times of the importance
and prevalence of cell division. While there are a few cells in the body
that do not undergo cell division (such as gametes, red blood cells,
most neurons, and some muscle cells), most somatic cells divide
regularly. A <span data-type="term">somatic cell</span> is a general
term for a body cell, and all human cells, except for the cells that
produce eggs and sperm (which are referred to as germ cells), are
somatic cells. Somatic cells contain <em data-effect="italics">two
</em>copies of each of their chromosomes (one copy received from each
parent). A <span data-type="term">homologous</span> pair of chromosomes
is the two copies of a single chromosome found in each somatic cell. The
human is a <span data-type="term">diploid</span> organism, having 23
homologous pairs of chromosomes in each of the somatic cells. The
condition of having pairs of chromosomes is known as diploidy.

Cells in the body replace themselves over the lifetime of a person. For
example, the cells lining the gastrointestinal tract must be frequently
replaced when constantly “worn off” by the movement of food through the
gut. But what triggers a cell to divide, and how does it prepare for and
complete cell division? The <span data-type="term">cell cycle</span> is
the sequence of events in the life of the cell from the moment it is
created at the end of a previous cycle of cell division until it then
divides itself, generating two new cells.

# The Cell Cycle
{: data-type="title"}

One “turn” or cycle of the cell cycle consists of two general phases:
interphase, followed by mitosis and cytokinesis. <span
data-type="term">Interphase</span> is the period of the cell cycle
during which the cell is not dividing. The majority of cells are in
interphase most of the time. <span data-type="term">Mitosis</span> is
the division of genetic material, during which the cell nucleus breaks
down and two new, fully functional, nuclei are formed. <span
data-type="term">Cytokinesis</span> divides the cytoplasm into two
distinctive cells.

## Interphase
{: data-type="title"}

A cell grows and carries out all normal metabolic functions and
processes in a period called G<sub>1</sub>
([\[link\]](#fig-ch03_05_01){: .autogenerated-content}). <span
data-type="term">G<sub>1</sub> phase</span> (gap 1 phase) is the first
gap, or growth phase in the cell cycle. For cells that will divide
again, G<sub>1</sub> is followed by replication of the DNA, during the S
phase. The <span data-type="term">S phase</span> (synthesis phase) is
period during which a cell replicates its DNA.

The two major phases of the cell cycle include mitosis (cell division),
and interphase, when the cell grows and performs all of its normal
functions. Interphase is further subdivided into G<sub>1</sub>, S, and
G<sub>2</sub> phases.

</figure>
After the synthesis phase, the cell proceeds through the G<sub>2</sub>
phase. The <span data-type="term">G<sub>2</sub> phase</span> is a second
gap phase, during which the cell continues to grow and makes the
necessary preparations for mitosis. Between G<sub>1</sub>, S, and
G<sub>2</sub> phases, cells will vary the most in their duration of the
G1 phase. It is here that a cell might spend a couple of hours, or many
days. The S phase typically lasts between 8-10 hours and the
G<sub>2</sub> phase approximately 5 hours. In contrast to these phases,
the <span data-type="term">G<sub>0</sub> phase</span> is a resting phase
of the cell cycle. Cells that have temporarily stopped dividing and are
resting (a common condition) and cells that have permanently ceased
dividing (like nerve cells) are said to be in G<sub>0</sub>.

## The Structure of Chromosomes
{: data-type="title"}

Billions of cells in the human body divide every day. During the
synthesis phase (S, for DNA synthesis) of interphase, the amount of DNA
within the cell precisely doubles. Therefore, after DNA replication but
before cell division, each cell actually contains <em
data-effect="italics">two </em>copies of each chromosome. Each copy of
the chromosome is referred to as a <span data-type="term">sister
chromatid</span> and is physically bound to the other copy. The <span
data-type="term">centromere</span> is the structure that attaches one
sister chromatid to another. Because a human cell has 46 chromosomes,
during this phase, there are 92 chromatids (46 × 2) in the cell. Make
sure not to confuse the concept of a pair of chromatids (one chromosome
and its exact copy attached during mitosis) and a homologous pair of
chromosomes (two paired chromosomes which were inherited separately, one
from each parent) ([\[link\]](#fig-ch03_05_02){:
.autogenerated-content}).

## Mitosis and Cytokinesis
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">mitotic phase</span> of the cell typically
takes between 1 and 2 hours. During this phase, a cell undergoes two
major processes. First, it completes mitosis, during which the contents
of the nucleus are equitably pulled apart and distributed between its
two halves. Cytokinesis then occurs, dividing the cytoplasm and cell
body into two new cells. Mitosis is divided into four major stages that
take place after interphase ([\[link\]](#fig-ch03_05_03){:
.autogenerated-content}) and in the following order: prophase,
metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The process is then followed by
cytokinesis.

</span>
</figure>
<span data-type="term">Prophase</span> is the first phase of mitosis,
during which the loosely packed chromatin coils and condenses into
visible chromosomes. During prophase, each chromosome becomes visible
with its identical partner attached, forming the familiar X-shape of
sister chromatids. The nucleolus disappears early during this phase, and
the nuclear envelope also disintegrates.
{: #fs-id1284144}

A major occurrence during prophase concerns a very important structure
that contains the origin site for microtubule growth. Recall the
cellular structures called centrioles that serve as origin points from
which microtubules extend. These tiny structures also play a very
important role during mitosis. A <span
data-type="term">centrosome</span> is a pair of centrioles together. The
cell contains two centrosomes side-by-side, which begin to move apart
during prophase. As the centrosomes migrate to two different sides of
the cell, microtubules begin to extend from each like long fingers from
two hands extending toward each other. The <span
data-type="term">mitotic spindle</span> is the structure composed of the
centrosomes and their emerging microtubules.
{: #fs-id1212990}

Near the end of prophase there is an invasion of the nuclear area by
microtubules from the mitotic spindle. The nuclear membrane has
disintegrated, and the microtubules attach themselves to the centromeres
that adjoin pairs of sister chromatids. The <span
data-type="term">kinetochore</span> is a protein structure on the
centromere that is the point of attachment between the mitotic spindle
and the sister chromatids. This stage is referred to as late prophase or
“prometaphase” to indicate the transition between prophase and
metaphase.
{: #fs-id1864386}

<span data-type="term">Metaphase</span> is the second stage of mitosis.
During this stage, the sister chromatids, with their attached
microtubules, line up along a linear plane in the middle of the cell. A
metaphase plate forms between the centrosomes that are now located at
either end of the cell. The <span data-type="term">metaphase
plate</span> is the name for the plane through the center of the spindle
on which the sister chromatids are positioned. The microtubules are now
poised to pull apart the sister chromatids and bring one from each pair
to each side of the cell.
{: #fs-id1025643}

<span data-type="term">Anaphase</span> is the third stage of mitosis.
Anaphase takes place over a few minutes, when the pairs of sister
chromatids are separated from one another, forming individual
chromosomes once again. These chromosomes are pulled to opposite ends of
the cell by their kinetochores, as the microtubules shorten. Each end of
the cell receives one partner from each pair of sister chromatids,
ensuring that the two new daughter cells will contain identical genetic
material.
{: #fs-id1259347}

<span data-type="term">Telophase</span> is the final stage of mitosis.
Telophase is characterized by the formation of two new daughter nuclei
at either end of the dividing cell. These newly formed nuclei surround
the genetic material, which uncoils such that the chromosomes return to
loosely packed chromatin. Nucleoli also reappear within the new nuclei,
and the mitotic spindle breaks apart, each new cell receiving its own
complement of DNA, organelles, membranes, and centrioles. At this point,
the cell is already beginning to split in half as cytokinesis begins.
{: #fs-id1804332}

The <span data-type="term">cleavage furrow</span> is a contractile band
made up of microfilaments that forms around the midline of the cell
during cytokinesis. (Recall that microfilaments consist of actin.) This
contractile band squeezes the two cells apart until they finally
separate. Two new cells are now formed. One of these cells (the “stem
cell”) enters its own cell cycle; able to grow and divide again at some
future time. The other cell transforms into the functional cell of the
tissue, typically replacing an “old” cell there.
{: #fs-id2209015}

Imagine a cell that completed mitosis but never underwent cytokinesis.
In some cases, a cell may divide its genetic material and grow in size,
but fail to undergo cytokinesis. This results in larger cells with more
than one nucleus. Usually this is an unwanted aberration and can be a
sign of cancerous cells.

# Cell Cycle Control
{: data-type="title"}

A very elaborate and precise system of regulation controls direct the
way cells proceed from one phase to the next in the cell cycle and begin
mitosis. The control system involves molecules within the cell as well
as external triggers. These internal and external control triggers
provide “stop” and “advance” signals for the cell. Precise regulation of
the cell cycle is critical for maintaining the health of an organism,
and loss of cell cycle control can lead to cancer.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1301044" markdown="1">
## Mechanisms of Cell Cycle Control
{: data-type="title"}

As the cell proceeds through its cycle, each phase involves certain
processes that must be completed before the cell should advance to the
next phase. A <span data-type="term">checkpoint</span> is a point in the
cell cycle at which the cycle can be signaled to move forward or
stopped. At each of these checkpoints, different varieties of molecules
provide the stop or go signals, depending on certain conditions within
the cell. A <span data-type="term">cyclin</span> is one of the primary
classes of cell cycle control molecules ([\[link\]](#fig-ch03_05_04){:
.autogenerated-content}). A <span data-type="term">cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK)</span> is one of a group of molecules that work together
with cyclins to determine progression past cell checkpoints. By
interacting with many additional molecules, these triggers push the cell
cycle forward unless prevented from doing so by “stop” signals, if for
some reason the cell is not ready. At the G<sub>1 </sub>checkpoint, the
cell must be ready for DNA synthesis to occur. At the G<sub>2</sub>
checkpoint the cell must be fully prepared for mitosis. Even during
mitosis, a crucial stop and go checkpoint in metaphase ensures that the
cell is fully prepared to complete cell division. The metaphase
checkpoint ensures that all sister chromatids are properly attached to
their respective microtubules and lined up at the metaphase plate before
the signal is given to separate them during anaphase.

## The Cell Cycle Out of Control: Implications
{: data-type="title"}

Most people understand that cancer or tumors are caused by abnormal
cells that multiply continuously. If the abnormal cells continue to
divide unstopped, they can damage the tissues around them, spread to
other parts of the body, and eventually result in death. In healthy
cells, the tight regulation mechanisms of the cell cycle prevent this
from happening, while failures of cell cycle control can cause unwanted
and excessive cell division. Failures of control may be caused by
inherited genetic abnormalities that compromise the function of certain
“stop” and “go” signals. Environmental insult that damages DNA can also
cause dysfunction in those signals. Often, a combination of both genetic
predisposition and environmental factors lead to cancer.
{: #fs-id1476740}

The process of a cell escaping its normal control system and becoming
cancerous may actually happen throughout the body quite frequently.
Fortunately, certain cells of the immune system are capable of
recognizing cells that have become cancerous and destroying them.
However, in certain cases the cancerous cells remain undetected and
continue to proliferate. If the resulting tumor does not pose a threat
to surrounding tissues, it is said to be benign and can usually be
easily removed. If capable of damage, the tumor is considered malignant
and the patient is diagnosed with cancer.

<div data-type="title">
Homeostatic Imbalances
</div>
<span data-type="title">Cancer Arises from Homeostatic Imbalances</span>
Cancer is an extremely complex condition, capable of arising from a wide
variety of genetic and environmental causes. Typically, mutations or
aberrations in a cell’s DNA that compromise normal cell cycle control
systems lead to cancerous tumors. Cell cycle control is an example of a
homeostatic mechanism that maintains proper cell function and health.
While progressing through the phases of the cell cycle, a large variety
of intracellular molecules provide stop and go signals to regulate
movement forward to the next phase. These signals are maintained in an
intricate balance so that the cell only proceeds to the next phase when
it is ready. This homeostatic control of the cell cycle can be thought
of like a car’s cruise control. Cruise control will continually apply
just the right amount of acceleration to maintain a desired speed,
unless the driver hits the brakes, in which case the car will slow down.
Similarly, the cell includes molecular messengers, such as cyclins, that
push the cell forward in its cycle.
{: #fs-id1119555}

In addition to cyclins, a class of proteins that are encoded by genes
called proto-oncogenes provide important signals that regulate the cell
cycle and move it forward. Examples of proto-oncogene products include
cell-surface receptors for growth factors, or cell-signaling molecules,
two classes of molecules that can promote DNA replication and cell
division. In contrast, a second class of genes known as tumor suppressor
genes sends stop signals during a cell cycle. For example, certain
protein products of tumor suppressor genes signal potential problems
with the DNA and thus stop the cell from dividing, while other proteins
signal the cell to die if it is damaged beyond repair. Some tumor
suppressor proteins also signal a sufficient surrounding cellular
density, which indicates that the cell need not presently divide. The
latter function is uniquely important in preventing tumor growth: normal
cells exhibit a phenomenon called “contact inhibition;” thus, extensive
cellular contact with neighboring cells causes a signal that stops
further cell division.
{: #fs-id2192433}

These two contrasting classes of genes, proto-oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes, are like the accelerator and brake pedal of the cell’s
own “cruise control system,” respectively. Under normal conditions,
these stop and go signals are maintained in a homeostatic balance.
Generally speaking, there are two ways that the cell’s cruise control
can lose control: a malfunctioning (overactive) accelerator, or a
malfunctioning (underactive) brake. When compromised through a mutation,
or otherwise altered, proto-oncogenes can be converted to oncogenes,
which produce oncoproteins that push a cell forward in its cycle and
stimulate cell division even when it is undesirable to do so. For
example, a cell that should be programmed to self-destruct (a process
called apoptosis) due to extensive DNA damage might instead be triggered
to proliferate by an oncoprotein. On the other hand, a dysfunctional
tumor suppressor gene may fail to provide the cell with a necessary stop
signal, also resulting in unwanted cell division and proliferation.
{: #fs-id850869}

A delicate homeostatic balance between the many proto-oncogenes and
tumor suppressor genes delicately controls the cell cycle and ensures
that only healthy cells replicate. Therefore, a disruption of this
homeostatic balance can cause aberrant cell division and cancerous
growths.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The life of cell consists of stages that make up the cell cycle. After a
cell is born, it passes through an interphase before it is ready to
replicate itself and produce daughter cells. This interphase includes
two gap phases (G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>), as well as an S phase,
during which its DNA is replicated in preparation for cell division. The
cell cycle is under precise regulation by chemical messengers both
inside and outside the cell that provide “stop” and “go” signals for
movement from one phase to the next. Failures of these signals can
result in cells that continue to divide uncontrollably, which can lead
to cancer.
{: #fs-id1171884}

Once a cell has completed interphase and is ready for cell division, it
proceeds through four separate stages of mitosis (prophase, metaphase,
anaphase, and telophase). Telophase is followed by the division of the
cytoplasm (cytokinesis), which generates two daughter cells. This
process takes place in all normally dividing cells of the body except
for the germ cells that produce eggs and sperm.
