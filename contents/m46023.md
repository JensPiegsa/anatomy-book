Now that you have learned that the cell membrane surrounds all cells,
you can dive inside of a prototypical human cell to learn about its
internal components and their functions. All living cells in
multicellular organisms contain an internal cytoplasmic compartment, and
a nucleus within the cytoplasm. <span data-type="term">Cytosol</span>,
the jelly-like substance within the cell, provides the fluid medium
necessary for biochemical reactions. Eukaryotic cells, including all
animal cells, also contain various cellular organelles. An <span

different types of membrane-enclosed bodies in the cell, each performing
a unique function. Just as the various bodily organs work together in
harmony to perform all of a human’s functions, the many different
cellular organelles work together to keep the cell healthy and
performing all of its important functions. The organelles and cytosol,

# Organelles of the Endomembrane System
{: data-type="title"}

A set of three major organelles together form a system within the cell
called the endomembrane system. These organelles work together to
perform various cellular jobs, including the task of producing,
packaging, and exporting certain cellular products. The organelles of
the endomembrane system include the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi
apparatus, and vesicles.

## Endoplasmic Reticulum
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">endoplasmic reticulum (ER)</span> is a system
of channels that is continuous with the nuclear membrane (or “envelope”)
covering the nucleus and composed of the same lipid bilayer material.
The ER can be thought of as a series of winding thoroughfares similar to
the waterway canals in Venice. The ER provides passages throughout much
of the cell that function in transporting, synthesizing, and storing
materials. The winding structure of the ER results in a large membranous
surface area that supports its many functions
([\[link\]](#fig-ch03_02_02){: .autogenerated-content}).

</figure>
Endoplasmic reticulum can exist in two forms: rough ER and smooth ER.
These two types of ER perform some very different functions and can be
found in very different amounts depending on the type of cell. Rough ER
(RER) is so-called because its membrane is dotted with embedded
granules—organelles called ribosomes, giving the RER a bumpy appearance.
A <span data-type="term">ribosome</span> is an organelle that serves as
the site of protein synthesis. It is composed of two ribosomal RNA
subunits that wrap around mRNA to start the process of translation,
followed by protein synthesis. Smooth ER (SER) lacks these ribosomes.
{: #fs-id2552695}

One of the main functions of the smooth ER is in the synthesis of
lipids. The smooth ER synthesizes phospholipids, the main component of
biological membranes, as well as steroid hormones. For this reason,
cells that produce large quantities of such hormones, such as those of
the female ovaries and male testes, contain large amounts of smooth ER.
In addition to lipid synthesis, the smooth ER also sequesters (i.e.,
stores) and regulates the concentration of cellular Ca<sup>++</sup>, a
function extremely important in cells of the nervous system where
Ca<sup>++</sup> is the trigger for neurotransmitter release. The smooth
ER additionally metabolizes some carbohydrates and performs a
detoxification role, breaking down certain toxins.
{: #fs-id1858545}

In contrast with the smooth ER, the primary job of the rough ER is the
synthesis and modification of proteins destined for the cell membrane or
for export from the cell. For this protein synthesis, many ribosomes
attach to the ER (giving it the studded appearance of rough ER).
Typically, a protein is synthesized within the ribosome and released
inside the channel of the rough ER, where sugars can be added to it (by
a process called glycosylation) before it is transported within a
vesicle to the next stage in the packaging and shipping process: the
Golgi apparatus.

## The Golgi Apparatus
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">Golgi apparatus</span> is responsible for
sorting, modifying, and shipping off the products that come from the
rough ER, much like a post-office. The Golgi apparatus looks like
stacked flattened discs, almost like stacks of oddly shaped pancakes.
Like the ER, these discs are membranous. The Golgi apparatus has two
distinct sides, each with a different role. One side of the apparatus
receives products in vesicles. These products are sorted through the
apparatus, and then they are released from the opposite side after being
repackaged into new vesicles. If the product is to be exported from the
cell, the vesicle migrates to the cell surface and fuses to the cell
membrane, and the cargo is secreted ([\[link\]](#fig-ch03_02_03){:
.autogenerated-content}).

Golgi Apparatus
</div>
<figcaption>
(a) The Golgi apparatus manipulates products from the rough ER, and also
produces new organelles called lysosomes. Proteins and other products of
the ER are sent to the Golgi apparatus, which organizes, modifies,
packages, and tags them. Some of these products are transported to other
areas of the cell and some are exported from the cell through
exocytosis. Enzymatic proteins are packaged as new lysosomes (or
packaged and sent for fusion with existing lysosomes). (b) An electron

## Lysosomes
{: data-type="title"}

Some of the protein products packaged by the Golgi include digestive
enzymes that are meant to remain inside the cell for use in breaking
down certain materials. The enzyme-containing vesicles released by the
Golgi may form new lysosomes, or fuse with existing, lysosomes. A <span
data-type="term">lysosome</span> is an organelle that contains enzymes
that break down and digest unneeded cellular components, such as a
damaged organelle. (A lysosome is similar to a wrecking crew that takes
down old and unsound buildings in a neighborhood.) <span
data-type="term">Autophagy</span> (“self-eating”) is the process of a
cell digesting its own structures. Lysosomes are also important for
breaking down foreign material. For example, when certain immune defense
cells (white blood cells) phagocytize bacteria, the bacterial cell is
transported into a lysosome and digested by the enzymes inside. As one
might imagine, such phagocytic defense cells contain large numbers of
lysosomes.
{: #fs-id2027468}

Under certain circumstances, lysosomes perform a more grand and dire
function. In the case of damaged or unhealthy cells, lysosomes can be
triggered to open up and release their digestive enzymes into the
cytoplasm of the cell, killing the cell. This “self-destruct” mechanism
is called <span data-type="term">autolysis</span>, and makes the process
of cell death controlled (a mechanism called “apoptosis”).

# Organelles for Energy Production and Detoxification
{: data-type="title"}

In addition to the jobs performed by the endomembrane system, the cell
has many other important functions. Just as you must consume nutrients
to provide yourself with energy, so must each of your cells take in
nutrients, some of which convert to chemical energy that can be used to
power biochemical reactions. Another important function of the cell is
detoxification. Humans take in all sorts of toxins from the environment
and also produce harmful chemicals as byproducts of cellular processes.
Cells called hepatocytes in the liver detoxify many of these toxins.

## Mitochondria
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">mitochondrion</span> (plural = mitochondria) is
a membranous, bean-shaped organelle that is the “energy transformer” of
the cell. Mitochondria consist of an outer lipid bilayer membrane as
well as an additional inner lipid bilayer membrane
([\[link\]](#fig-ch03_02_04){: .autogenerated-content}). The inner
membrane is highly folded into winding structures with a great deal of
surface area, called cristae. It is along this inner membrane that a
series of proteins, enzymes, and other molecules perform the biochemical
reactions of cellular respiration. These reactions convert energy stored
in nutrient molecules (such as glucose) into adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), which provides usable cellular energy to the cell. Cells use ATP
constantly, and so the mitochondria are constantly at work. Oxygen
molecules are required during cellular respiration, which is why you
must constantly breathe it in. One of the organ systems in the body that
uses huge amounts of ATP is the muscular system because ATP is required
to sustain muscle contraction. As a result, muscle cells are packed full
of mitochondria. Nerve cells also need large quantities of ATP to run
their sodium-potassium pumps. Therefore, an individual neuron will be
loaded with over a thousand mitochondria. On the other hand, a bone
cell, which is not nearly as metabolically-active, might only have a
couple hundred mitochondria.

## Peroxisomes
{: data-type="title"}

Like lysosomes, a <span data-type="term">peroxisome</span> is a
membrane-bound cellular organelle that contains mostly enzymes
([\[link\]](#fig-ch03_02_05){: .autogenerated-content}). Peroxisomes
perform a couple of different functions, including lipid metabolism and
chemical detoxification. In contrast to the digestive enzymes found in
lysosomes, the enzymes within peroxisomes serve to transfer hydrogen
atoms from various molecules to oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide
(H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). In this way, peroxisomes neutralize
poisons such as alcohol. In order to appreciate the importance of
peroxisomes, it is necessary to understand the concept of reactive
oxygen species.

</figure>
<span data-type="term">Reactive oxygen species (ROS)</span> such as
peroxides and free radicals are the highly reactive products of many
normal cellular processes, including the mitochondrial reactions that
produce ATP and oxygen metabolism. Examples of ROS include the hydroxyl
radical OH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and superoxide (<math
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msubsup>
<mtext>O</mtext> <mn>2</mn> <mo>−</mo> </msubsup> </mrow> </math>

). Some ROS are important for certain cellular functions, such as cell
signaling processes and immune responses against foreign substances.
Free radicals are reactive because they contain free unpaired electrons;
they can easily oxidize other molecules throughout the cell, causing
cellular damage and even cell death. Free radicals are thought to play a
role in many destructive processes in the body, from cancer to coronary
artery disease.
{: #fs-id1863415}

Peroxisomes, on the other hand, oversee reactions that neutralize free
radicals. Peroxisomes produce large amounts of the toxic
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the process, but peroxisomes contain
enzymes that convert H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into water and oxygen.
These byproducts are safely released into the cytoplasm. Like miniature
sewage treatment plants, peroxisomes neutralize harmful toxins so that
they do not wreak havoc in the cells. The liver is the organ primarily
responsible for detoxifying the blood before it travels throughout the
body, and liver cells contain an exceptionally high number of
peroxisomes.
{: #fs-id1517469}

Defense mechanisms such as detoxification within the peroxisome and
certain cellular antioxidants serve to neutralize many of these
molecules. Some vitamins and other substances, found primarily in fruits
and vegetables, have antioxidant properties. Antioxidants work by being
oxidized themselves, halting the destructive reaction cascades initiated
by the free radicals. Sometimes though, ROS accumulate beyond the
capacity of such defenses.
{: #fs-id1211842}

*Oxidative stress*{: data-effect="italics"} is the term used to describe
damage to cellular components caused by ROS. Due to their characteristic
unpaired electrons, ROS can set off chain reactions where they remove
electrons from other molecules, which then become oxidized and reactive,
and do the same to other molecules, causing a chain reaction. ROS can
cause permanent damage to cellular lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and
nucleic acids. Damaged DNA can lead to genetic mutations and even
cancer. A <span data-type="term">mutation</span> is a change in the
nucleotide sequence in a gene within a cell’s DNA, potentially altering
the protein coded by that gene. Other diseases believed to be triggered
or exacerbated by ROS include Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular
diseases, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, Huntington’s
disease, and schizophrenia, among many others. It is noteworthy that
these diseases are largely age-related. Many scientists believe that
oxidative stress is a major contributor to the aging process.

Aging and the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Cell: The Free Radical Theory</span> The free
radical theory on aging was originally proposed in the 1950s, and still
remains under debate. Generally speaking, the free radical theory of
aging suggests that accumulated cellular damage from oxidative stress
contributes to the physiological and anatomical effects of aging. There
are two significantly different versions of this theory: one states that
the aging process itself is a result of oxidative damage, and the other
states that oxidative damage causes age-related disease and disorders.
The latter version of the theory is more widely accepted than the
former. However, many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative damage
does contribute to the aging process. Research has shown that reducing
oxidative damage can result in a longer lifespan in certain organisms
such as yeast, worms, and fruit flies. Conversely, increasing oxidative
damage can shorten the lifespan of mice and worms. Interestingly, a
manipulation called calorie-restriction (moderately restricting the
caloric intake) has been shown to increase life span in some laboratory
animals. It is believed that this increase is at least in part due to a
reduction of oxidative stress. However, a long-term study of primates
with calorie-restriction showed no increase in their lifespan. A great
deal of additional research will be required to better understand the
link between reactive oxygen species and aging.

# The Cytoskeleton
{: data-type="title"}

Much like the bony skeleton structurally supports the human body, the
cytoskeleton helps the cells to maintain their structural integrity. The
<span data-type="term">cytoskeleton</span> is a group of fibrous
proteins that provide structural support for cells, but this is only one
of the functions of the cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components are also
critical for cell motility, cell reproduction, and transportation of
substances within the cell.
{: #fs-id1521089}

The cytoskeleton forms a complex thread-like network throughout the cell
consisting of three different kinds of protein-based filaments:
microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules
([\[link\]](#fig-ch03_02_06){: .autogenerated-content}). The thickest of
the three is the <span data-type="term">microtubule</span>, a structural
filament composed of subunits of a protein called tubulin. Microtubules
maintain cell shape and structure, help resist compression of the cell,
and play a role in positioning the organelles within the cell.
Microtubules also make up two types of cellular appendages important for
motion: cilia and flagella. <span data-type="term">Cilia</span> are
found on many cells of the body, including the epithelial cells that
line the airways of the respiratory system. Cilia move rhythmically;
they beat constantly, moving waste materials such as dust, mucus, and
bacteria upward through the airways, away from the lungs and toward the
mouth. Beating cilia on cells in the female fallopian tubes move egg
cells from the ovary towards the uterus. A <span
data-type="term">flagellum</span> (plural = flagella) is an appendage
larger than a cilium and specialized for cell locomotion. The only
flagellated cell in humans is the sperm cell that must propel itself
towards female egg cells.

The Three Components of the Cytoskeleton

The cytoskeleton consists of (a) microtubules, (b) microfilaments, and

maintaining cell shape and structure, promoting cellular movement, and
aiding cell division.

data-media-type="image/jpg" width="520"} </span>
</figure>
A very important function of microtubules is to set the paths (somewhat
like railroad tracks) along which the genetic material can be pulled (a
process requiring ATP) during cell division, so that each new daughter
cell receives the appropriate set of chromosomes. Two short, identical
microtubule structures called centrioles are found near the nucleus of
cells. A <span data-type="term">centriole</span> can serve as the
cellular origin point for microtubules extending outward as cilia or
flagella or can assist with the separation of DNA during cell division.
Microtubules grow out from the centrioles by adding more tubulin
subunits, like adding additional links to a chain.
{: #fs-id1524473}

In contrast with microtubules, the <span
data-type="term">microfilament</span> is a thinner type of cytoskeletal
filament (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch03_02_06){:
.autogenerated-content}**b**{: data-effect="bold"}). Actin, a protein
that forms chains, is the primary component of these microfilaments.
Actin fibers, twisted chains of actin filaments, constitute a large
component of muscle tissue and, along with the protein myosin, are
responsible for muscle contraction. Like microtubules, actin filaments
are long chains of single subunits (called actin subunits). In muscle
cells, these long actin strands, called thin filaments, are “pulled” by
thick filaments of the myosin protein to contract the cell.
{: #fs-id1493979}

Actin also has an important role during cell division. When a cell is
about to split in half during cell division, actin filaments work with
myosin to create a cleavage furrow that eventually splits the cell down
the middle, forming two new cells from the original cell.
{: #fs-id1094713}

The final cytoskeletal filament is the intermediate filament. As its
name would suggest, an<span data-type="term"> intermediate
filament</span> is a filament intermediate in thickness between the
microtubules and microfilaments (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch03_02_06){:
.autogenerated-content}**c**{: data-effect="bold"}). Intermediate
filaments are made up of long fibrous subunits of a protein called
keratin that are wound together like the threads that compose a rope.
Intermediate filaments, in concert with the microtubules, are important
for maintaining cell shape and structure. Unlike the microtubules, which
resist compression, intermediate filaments resist tension—the forces
that pull apart cells. There are many cases in which cells are prone to
tension, such as when epithelial cells of the skin are compressed,
tugging them in different directions. Intermediate filaments help anchor
organelles together within a cell and also link cells to other cells by
forming special cell-to-cell junctions.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The internal environmental of a living cell is made up of a fluid,
jelly-like substance called cytosol, which consists mainly of water, but
also contains various dissolved nutrients and other molecules. The cell
contains an array of cellular organelles, each one performing a unique
function and helping to maintain the health and activity of the cell.
The cytosol and organelles together compose the cell’s cytoplasm. Most
organelles are surrounded by a lipid membrane similar to the cell
membrane of the cell. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus,
and lysosomes share a functional connectivity and are collectively
referred to as the endomembrane system. There are two types of ER:
smooth and rough. While the smooth ER performs many functions, including
lipid synthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly responsible for
protein synthesis using its associated ribosomes. The rough ER sends
newly made proteins to the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and
packaged for delivery to various locations within or outside of the
cell. Some of these protein products are enzymes destined to break down
unwanted material and are packaged as lysosomes for use inside the cell.
{: #fs-id1639757}

Cells also contain mitochondria and peroxisomes, which are the
organelles responsible for producing the cell’s energy supply and
detoxifying certain chemicals, respectively. Biochemical reactions
within mitochondria transform energy-carrying molecules into the usable
form of cellular energy known as ATP. Peroxisomes contain enzymes that
transform harmful substances such as free radicals into oxygen and
water. Cells also contain a miniaturized “skeleton” of protein filaments
that extend throughout its interior. Three different kinds of filaments
compose this cytoskeleton (in order of increasing thickness):
microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Each
cytoskeletal component performs unique functions as well as provides a
supportive framework for the cell.

Explain why the structure of the ER, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus
assist their respective functions.
{: #fs-id986759}

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1527750" data-label="" markdown="1">
The structure of the Golgi apparatus is suited to its function because
it is a series of flattened membranous discs; substances are modified
and packaged in sequential steps as they travel from one disc to the
next. The structure of Golgi apparatus also involves a receiving face
and a sending face, which organize cellular products as they enter and
leave the Golgi apparatus. The ER and the mitochondria both have
structural specializations that increase their surface area. In the
mitochondria, the inner membrane is extensively folded, which increases
surface area for ATP production. Likewise, the ER is elaborately wound
throughout the cell, increasing its surface area for functions like
lipid synthesis, Ca<sup>++</sup> storage, and protein synthesis.

Peroxisomes and lysosomes are both cellular organelles bound by lipid
bilayer membranes, and they both contain many enzymes. However,
peroxisomes contain enzymes that detoxify substances by transferring
hydrogen atoms and producing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas the
enzymes in lysosomes function to break down and digest various unwanted
materials.
