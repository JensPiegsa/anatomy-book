The <span data-type="term">cranium</span> (skull) is the skeletal
structure of the head that supports the face and protects the brain. It
is subdivided into the <span data-type="term">facial bones</span> and
the <span data-type="term">brain case</span>, or cranial vault
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_01){: .autogenerated-content}). The facial
bones underlie the facial structures, form the nasal cavity, enclose the
eyeballs, and support the teeth of the upper and lower jaws. The rounded
brain case surrounds and protects the brain and houses the middle and
inner ear structures.
{: #fs-id1640586}

In the adult, the skull consists of 22 individual bones, 21 of which are
immobile and united into a single unit. The 22nd bone is the <span
data-type="term">mandible</span> (lower jaw), which is the only moveable
bone of the skull.

# Anterior View of Skull
{: data-type="title"}

The anterior skull consists of the facial bones and provides the bony
support for the eyes and structures of the face. This view of the skull
is dominated by the openings of the orbits and the nasal cavity. Also
seen are the upper and lower jaws, with their respective teeth
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_02){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1938489}

The <span data-type="term">orbit</span> is the bony socket that houses
the eyeball and muscles that move the eyeball or open the upper eyelid.
The upper margin of the anterior orbit is the <span
data-type="term">supraorbital margin</span>. Located near the midpoint
of the supraorbital margin is a small opening called the <span
data-type="term">supraorbital foramen</span>. This provides for passage
of a sensory nerve to the skin of the forehead. Below the orbit is the
<span data-type="term">infraorbital foramen</span>, which is the point
of emergence for a sensory nerve that supplies the anterior face below
the orbit.

Inside the nasal area of the skull, the <span data-type="term">nasal
cavity</span> is divided into halves by the <span data-type="term">nasal
septum</span>. The upper portion of the nasal septum is formed by the
<span data-type="term">perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone</span>
and the lower portion is the <span data-type="term">vomer bone</span>.
Each side of the nasal cavity is triangular in shape, with a broad
inferior space that narrows superiorly. When looking into the nasal
cavity from the front of the skull, two bony plates are seen projecting
from each lateral wall. The larger of these is the <span
data-type="term">inferior nasal concha</span>, an independent bone of
the skull. Located just above the inferior concha is the <span
data-type="term">middle nasal concha</span>, which is part of the
ethmoid bone. A third bony plate, also part of the ethmoid bone, is the
<span data-type="term">superior nasal concha</span>. It is much smaller
and out of sight, above the middle concha. The superior nasal concha is
located just lateral to the perpendicular plate, in the upper nasal
cavity.

# Lateral View of Skull
{: data-type="title"}

A view of the lateral skull is dominated by the large, rounded brain
case above and the upper and lower jaws with their teeth below
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}). Separating
these areas is the bridge of bone called the zygomatic arch. The <span
data-type="term">zygomatic arch</span> is the bony arch on the side of
skull that spans from the area of the cheek to just above the ear canal.
It is formed by the junction of two bony processes: a short anterior
component, the <span data-type="term">temporal process of the zygomatic
bone</span> (the cheekbone) and a longer posterior portion, the <span
data-type="term">zygomatic process of the temporal bone</span>,
extending forward from the temporal bone. Thus the temporal process
(anteriorly) and the zygomatic process (posteriorly) join together, like
the two ends of a drawbridge, to form the zygomatic arch. One of the
major muscles that pulls the mandible upward during biting and chewing
arises from the zygomatic arch.
{: #fs-id1285208}

On the lateral side of the brain case, above the level of the zygomatic
arch, is a shallow space called the <span data-type="term">temporal
fossa</span>. Below the level of the zygomatic arch and deep to the
vertical portion of the mandible is another space called the <span
data-type="term">infratemporal fossa</span>. Both the temporal fossa and
infratemporal fossa contain muscles that act on the mandible during
chewing.

# Bones of the Brain Case
{: data-type="title"}

The brain case contains and protects the brain. The interior space that
is almost completely occupied by the brain is called the <span
data-type="term">cranial cavity</span>. This cavity is bounded
superiorly by the rounded top of the skull, which is called the <span
data-type="term">calvaria</span> (skullcap), and the lateral and
posterior sides of the skull. The bones that form the top and sides of
the brain case are usually referred to as the “flat” bones of the skull.
{: #fs-id1256378}

The floor of the brain case is referred to as the base of the skull.
This is a complex area that varies in depth and has numerous openings
for the passage of cranial nerves, blood vessels, and the spinal cord.
Inside the skull, the base is subdivided into three large spaces, called
the <span data-type="term">anterior cranial fossa</span>, <span
data-type="term">middle cranial fossa</span>, and <span
data-type="term">posterior cranial fossa</span> (fossa = “trench or
ditch”) ([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_04){: .autogenerated-content}). From
anterior to posterior, the fossae increase in depth. The shape and depth
of each fossa corresponds to the shape and size of the brain region that
each houses. The boundaries and openings of the cranial fossae (singular
= fossa) will be described in a later section.

## Parietal Bone
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">parietal bone</span> forms most of the upper
lateral side of the skull (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). These are paired bones, with the right and
left parietal bones joining together at the top of the skull. Each
parietal bone is also bounded anteriorly by the frontal bone, inferiorly
by the temporal bone, and posteriorly by the occipital bone.

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1248275" markdown="1">
## Temporal Bone
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">temporal bone</span> forms the lower lateral
side of the skull (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). Common wisdom has it that the temporal bone
(temporal = “time”) is so named because this area of the head (the
temple) is where hair typically first turns gray, indicating the passage
of time.
{: #fs-id1471081}

The temporal bone is subdivided into several regions
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_05){: .autogenerated-content}). The flattened,
upper portion is the squamous portion of the temporal bone. Below this
area and projecting anteriorly is the zygomatic process of the temporal
bone, which forms the posterior portion of the zygomatic arch.
Posteriorly is the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Projecting
inferiorly from this region is a large prominence, the <span
data-type="term">mastoid process</span>, which serves as a muscle
attachment site. The mastoid process can easily be felt on the side of
the head just behind your earlobe. On the interior of the skull, the
petrous portion of each temporal bone forms the prominent, diagonally
oriented <span data-type="term">petrous ridge</span> in the floor of the
cranial cavity. Located inside each petrous ridge are small cavities
that house the structures of the middle and inner ears.

</figure>
Important landmarks of the temporal bone, as shown in
[\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_06){: .autogenerated-content}, include the
following:
{: #fs-id1953408}

* <span data-type="term">External acoustic meatus</span> (ear
  canal)—This is the large opening on the lateral side of the skull that
  is associated with the ear.
* <span data-type="term">Internal acoustic meatus</span>—This opening is
  located inside the cranial cavity, on the medial side of the petrous
  ridge. It connects to the middle and inner ear cavities of the
  temporal bone.
* <span data-type="term">Mandibular fossa</span>—This is the deep,
  oval-shaped depression located on the external base of the skull, just
  in front of the external acoustic meatus. The mandible (lower jaw)
  joins with the skull at this site as part of the temporomandibular
  joint, which allows for movements of the mandible during opening and
  closing of the mouth.
* <span data-type="term">Articular tubercle</span>—The smooth ridge
  located immediately anterior to the mandibular fossa. Both the
  articular tubercle and mandibular fossa contribute to the
  temporomandibular joint, the joint that provides for movements between
  the temporal bone of the skull and the mandible.
* <span data-type="term">Styloid process</span>—Posterior to the
  mandibular fossa on the external base of the skull is an elongated,
  downward bony projection called the styloid process, so named because
  of its resemblance to a stylus (a pen or writing tool). This structure
  serves as an attachment site for several small muscles and for a
  ligament that supports the hyoid bone of the neck. (See also
  [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_05){: .autogenerated-content}.)
* <span data-type="term">Stylomastoid foramen</span>—This small opening
  is located between the styloid process and mastoid process. This is
  the point of exit for the cranial nerve that supplies the facial
  muscles.
* <span data-type="term">Carotid canal</span>—The carotid canal is a
  zig-zag shaped tunnel that provides passage through the base of the
  skull for one of the major arteries that supplies the brain. Its
  entrance is located on the outside base of the skull, anteromedial to
  the styloid process. The canal then runs anteromedially within the
  bony base of the skull, and then turns upward to its exit in the floor
  of the middle cranial cavity, above the foramen lacerum.

## Frontal Bone
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">frontal bone</span> is the single bone that
forms the forehead. At its anterior midline, between the eyebrows, there
is a slight depression called the <span data-type="term">glabella</span>
(see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}). The frontal
bone also forms the supraorbital margin of the orbit. Near the middle of
this margin, is the supraorbital foramen, the opening that provides
passage for a sensory nerve to the forehead. The frontal bone is
thickened just above each supraorbital margin, forming rounded brow
ridges. These are located just behind your eyebrows and vary in size
among individuals, although they are generally larger in males. Inside
the cranial cavity, the frontal bone extends posteriorly. This flattened
region forms both the roof of the orbit below and the floor of the
anterior cranial cavity above (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_06){:
.autogenerated-content}**b**{: data-effect="bold"}).
{: #fs-id1283984}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1707040" markdown="1">
## Occipital Bone
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">occipital bone</span> is the single bone that
forms the posterior skull and posterior base of the cranial cavity
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_07){: .autogenerated-content}; see also
[\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_06){: .autogenerated-content}). On its outside
surface, at the posterior midline, is a small protrusion called the
<span data-type="term">external occipital protuberance</span>, which
serves as an attachment site for a ligament of the posterior neck.
Lateral to either side of this bump is a <span data-type="term">superior
nuchal line</span> (nuchal = “nape” or “posterior neck”). The nuchal
lines represent the most superior point at which muscles of the neck
attach to the skull, with only the scalp covering the skull above these
lines. On the base of the skull, the occipital bone contains the large
opening of the <span data-type="term">foramen magnum</span>, which
allows for passage of the spinal cord as it exits the skull. On either
side of the foramen magnum is an oval-shaped <span
data-type="term">occipital condyle</span>. These condyles form joints
with the first cervical vertebra and thus support the skull on top of
the vertebral column.

## Sphenoid Bone
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">sphenoid bone</span> is a single, complex
bone of the central skull ([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_08){:
.autogenerated-content}). It serves as a “keystone” bone, because it
joins with almost every other bone of the skull. The sphenoid forms much
of the base of the central skull (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_06){:
.autogenerated-content}) and also extends laterally to contribute to the
sides of the skull (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). Inside the cranial cavity, the right and left
<span data-type="term">lesser wings of the sphenoid bone</span>, which
resemble the wings of a flying bird, form the lip of a prominent ridge
that marks the boundary between the anterior and middle cranial fossae.
The <span data-type="term">sella turcica</span> (“Turkish saddle”) is
located at the midline of the middle cranial fossa. This bony region of
the sphenoid bone is named for its resemblance to the horse saddles used
by the Ottoman Turks, with a high back and a tall front. The rounded
depression in the floor of the sella turcica is the <span
data-type="term">hypophyseal (pituitary) fossa</span>, which houses the
pea-sized pituitary (hypophyseal) gland. The <span
data-type="term">greater wings of the sphenoid bone</span> extend
laterally to either side away from the sella turcica, where they form
the anterior floor of the middle cranial fossa. The greater wing is best
seen on the outside of the lateral skull, where it forms a rectangular
area immediately anterior to the squamous portion of the temporal bone.
{: #fs-id1469126}

On the inferior aspect of the skull, each half of the sphenoid bone
forms two thin, vertically oriented bony plates. These are the <span
data-type="term">medial pterygoid plate</span> and <span
data-type="term">lateral pterygoid plate</span> (pterygoid =
“wing-shaped”). The right and left medial pterygoid plates form the
posterior, lateral walls of the nasal cavity. The somewhat larger
lateral pterygoid plates serve as attachment sites for chewing muscles
that fill the infratemporal space and act on the mandible.

## Ethmoid Bone
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">ethmoid bone</span> is a single, midline bone
that forms the roof and lateral walls of the upper nasal cavity, the
upper portion of the nasal septum, and contributes to the medial wall of
the orbit ([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_09){: .autogenerated-content} and
[\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_10){: .autogenerated-content}). On the interior
of the skull, the ethmoid also forms a portion of the floor of the
anterior cranial cavity (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_06){:
.autogenerated-content}**b**{: data-effect="bold"}).
{: #fs-id1971405}

Within the nasal cavity, the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone
forms the upper portion of the nasal septum. The ethmoid bone also forms
the lateral walls of the upper nasal cavity. Extending from each lateral
wall are the superior nasal concha and middle nasal concha, which are
thin, curved projections that extend into the nasal cavity
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_11){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id2228601}

In the cranial cavity, the ethmoid bone forms a small area at the
midline in the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. This region also
forms the narrow roof of the underlying nasal cavity. This portion of
the ethmoid bone consists of two parts, the crista galli and cribriform
plates. The <span data-type="term">crista galli</span> (“rooster’s comb
or crest”) is a small upward bony projection located at the midline. It
functions as an anterior attachment point for one of the covering layers
of the brain. To either side of the crista galli is the <span
data-type="term">cribriform plate</span> (cribrum = “sieve”), a small,
flattened area with numerous small openings termed olfactory foramina.
Small nerve branches from the olfactory areas of the nasal cavity pass
through these openings to enter the brain.
{: #fs-id1977415}

The lateral portions of the ethmoid bone are located between the orbit
and upper nasal cavity, and thus form the lateral nasal cavity wall and
a portion of the medial orbit wall. Located inside this portion of the
ethmoid bone are several small, air-filled spaces that are part of the
paranasal sinus system of the skull.

# Sutures of the Skull
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">suture</span> is an immobile joint between
adjacent bones of the skull. The narrow gap between the bones is filled
with dense, fibrous connective tissue that unites the bones. The long
sutures located between the bones of the brain case are not straight,
but instead follow irregular, tightly twisting paths. These twisting
lines serve to tightly interlock the adjacent bones, thus adding
strength to the skull for brain protection.
{: #fs-id1195048}

The two suture lines seen on the top of the skull are the coronal and
sagittal sutures. The <span data-type="term">coronal suture</span> runs
from side to side across the skull, within the coronal plane of section
(see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}). It joins
the frontal bone to the right and left parietal bones. The <span
data-type="term">sagittal suture</span> extends posteriorly from the
coronal suture, running along the midline at the top of the skull in the
sagittal plane of section (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_07){:
.autogenerated-content}). It unites the right and left parietal bones.
On the posterior skull, the sagittal suture terminates by joining the
lambdoid suture. The <span data-type="term">lambdoid suture</span>
extends downward and laterally to either side away from its junction
with the sagittal suture. The lambdoid suture joins the occipital bone
to the right and left parietal and temporal bones. This suture is named
for its upside-down \"V\" shape, which resembles the capital letter
version of the Greek letter lambda (Λ). The <span
data-type="term">squamous suture</span> is located on the lateral skull.
It unites the squamous portion of the temporal bone with the parietal
bone (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}). At the
intersection of four bones is the <span data-type="term">pterion</span>,
a small, capital-H-shaped suture line region that unites the frontal
bone, parietal bone, squamous portion of the temporal bone, and greater
wing of the sphenoid bone. It is the weakest part of the skull. The
pterion is located approximately two finger widths above the zygomatic
arch and a thumb’s width posterior to the upward portion of the
zygomatic bone.

Disorders of the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Skeletal System</span> Head and traumatic brain
injuries are major causes of immediate death and disability, with
bleeding and infections as possible additional complications. According
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2010), approximately
30 percent of all injury-related deaths in the United States are caused
by head injuries. The majority of head injuries involve falls. They are
most common among young children (ages 0–4 years), adolescents (15–19
years), and the elderly (over 65 years). Additional causes vary, but
prominent among these are automobile and motorcycle accidents.
{: #fs-id875993}

Strong blows to the brain-case portion of the skull can produce
fractures. These may result in bleeding inside the skull with subsequent
injury to the brain. The most common is a linear skull fracture, in
which fracture lines radiate from the point of impact. Other fracture
types include a comminuted fracture, in which the bone is broken into
several pieces at the point of impact, or a depressed fracture, in which
the fractured bone is pushed inward. In a contrecoup (counterblow)
fracture, the bone at the point of impact is not broken, but instead a
fracture occurs on the opposite side of the skull. Fractures of the
occipital bone at the base of the skull can occur in this manner,
producing a basilar fracture that can damage the artery that passes
through the carotid canal.
{: #fs-id1972896}

A blow to the lateral side of the head may fracture the bones of the
pterion. The pterion is an important clinical landmark because located
immediately deep to it on the inside of the skull is a major branch of
an artery that supplies the skull and covering layers of the brain. A
strong blow to this region can fracture the bones around the pterion. If
the underlying artery is damaged, bleeding can cause the formation of a
hematoma (collection of blood) between the brain and interior of the
skull. As blood accumulates, it will put pressure on the brain. Symptoms
associated with a hematoma may not be apparent immediately following the
injury, but if untreated, blood accumulation will exert increasing
pressure on the brain and can result in death within a few hours.

The facial bones of the skull form the upper and lower jaws, the nose,
nasal cavity and nasal septum, and the orbit. The facial bones include
14 bones, with six paired bones and two unpaired bones. The paired bones
are the maxilla, palatine, zygomatic, nasal, lacrimal, and inferior
nasal conchae bones. The unpaired bones are the vomer and mandible
bones. Although classified with the brain-case bones, the ethmoid bone
also contributes to the nasal septum and the walls of the nasal cavity
and orbit.

The <span data-type="term">palatine bone</span> is one of a pair of
irregularly shaped bones that contribute small areas to the lateral
walls of the nasal cavity and the medial wall of each orbit. The largest
region of each of the palatine bone is the <span

<div data-type="title">
Homeostatic Imbalances
</div>
<span data-type="title">Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate</span> During
embryonic development, the right and left maxilla bones come together at
the midline to form the upper jaw. At the same time, the muscle and skin
overlying these bones join together to form the upper lip. Inside the
mouth, the palatine processes of the maxilla bones, along with the
horizontal plates of the right and left palatine bones, join together to
form the hard palate. If an error occurs in these developmental
processes, a birth defect of cleft lip or cleft palate may result.
{: #fs-id1845434}

Cleft lip is a common development defect that affects approximately
1:1000 births, most of which are male. This defect involves a partial or
complete failure of the right and left portions of the upper lip to fuse
together, leaving a cleft (gap).
{: #fs-id1363721}

A more severe developmental defect is cleft palate, which affects the
hard palate. The hard palate is the bony structure that separates the
nasal cavity from the oral cavity. It is formed during embryonic
development by the midline fusion of the horizontal plates from the
right and left palatine bones and the palatine processes of the maxilla
bones. Cleft palate affects approximately 1:2500 births and is more
common in females. It results from a failure of the two halves of the
hard palate to completely come together and fuse at the midline, thus
leaving a gap between them. This gap allows for communication between
the nasal and oral cavities. In severe cases, the bony gap continues
into the anterior upper jaw where the alveolar processes of the maxilla
bones also do not properly join together above the front teeth. If this
occurs, a cleft lip will also be seen. Because of the communication
between the oral and nasal cavities, a cleft palate makes it very
difficult for an infant to generate the suckling needed for nursing,
thus leaving the infant at risk for malnutrition. Surgical repair is
required to correct cleft palate defects.

[\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}). The anterior
portion of the lacrimal bone forms a shallow depression called the <span
data-type="term">lacrimal fossa</span>, and extending inferiorly from
this is the <span data-type="term">nasolacrimal canal</span>. The
lacrimal fluid (tears of the eye), which serves to maintain the moist
surface of the eye, drains at the medial corner of the eye into the
nasolacrimal canal. This duct then extends downward to open into the
nasal cavity, behind the inferior nasal concha. In the nasal cavity, the
lacrimal fluid normally drains posteriorly, but with an increased flow
of tears due to crying or eye irritation, some fluid will also drain
anteriorly, thus causing a runny nose.

## Mandible
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">mandible</span> forms the lower jaw and is
the only moveable bone of the skull. At the time of birth, the mandible
consists of paired right and left bones, but these fuse together during
the first year to form the single U-shaped mandible of the adult skull.
Each side of the mandible consists of a horizontal body and posteriorly,
a vertically oriented <span data-type="term">ramus of the
mandible</span> (ramus = “branch”). The outside margin of the mandible,
where the body and ramus come together is called the <span
data-type="term">angle of the mandible</span>
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_13){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1891273}

The ramus on each side of the mandible has two upward-going bony
projections. The more anterior projection is the flattened <span
data-type="term">coronoid process of the mandible</span>, which provides
attachment for one of the biting muscles. The posterior projection is
the <span data-type="term">condylar process of the mandible</span>,
which is topped by the oval-shaped <span
data-type="term">condyle</span>. The condyle of the mandible articulates
(joins) with the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal
bone. Together these articulations form the temporomandibular joint,
which allows for opening and closing of the mouth (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}). The broad
U-shaped curve located between the coronoid and condylar processes is
the <span data-type="term">mandibular notch</span>.
{: #fs-id1370107}

Important landmarks for the mandible include the following:
{: #fs-id1266931}

* <span data-type="term">Alveolar process of the mandible</span>—This is
  the upper border of the mandibular body and serves to anchor the lower
  teeth.
* <span data-type="term">Mental protuberance</span>—The forward
  projection from the inferior margin of the anterior mandible that
  forms the chin (mental = “chin”).
* <span data-type="term">Mental foramen</span>—The opening located on
  each side of the anterior-lateral mandible, which is the exit site for
  a sensory nerve that supplies the chin.
* <span data-type="term">Mylohyoid line</span>—This bony ridge extends
  along the inner aspect of the mandibular body (see
  [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_09){: .autogenerated-content}). The muscle
  that forms the floor of the oral cavity attaches to the mylohyoid
  lines on both sides of the mandible.
* <span data-type="term">Mandibular foramen</span>—This opening is
  located on the medial side of the ramus of the mandible. The opening
  leads into a tunnel that runs down the length of the mandibular body.
  The sensory nerve and blood vessels that supply the lower teeth enter
  the mandibular foramen and then follow this tunnel. Thus, to numb the
  lower teeth prior to dental work, the dentist must inject anesthesia
  into the lateral wall of the oral cavity at a point prior to where
  this sensory nerve enters the mandibular foramen.
* <span data-type="term">Lingula</span>—This small flap of bone is named
  for its shape (lingula = “little tongue”). It is located immediately
  next to the mandibular foramen, on the medial side of the ramus. A
  ligament that anchors the mandible during opening and closing of the
  mouth extends down from the base of the skull and attaches to the
  lingula.

# The Orbit
{: data-type="title"}

The orbit is the bony socket that houses the eyeball and contains the
muscles that move the eyeball or open the upper eyelid. Each orbit is
cone-shaped, with a narrow posterior region that widens toward the large
anterior opening. To help protect the eye, the bony margins of the
anterior opening are thickened and somewhat constricted. The medial
walls of the two orbits are parallel to each other but each lateral wall
diverges away from the midline at a 45° angle. This divergence provides
greater lateral peripheral vision.
{: #fs-id1883481}

The walls of each orbit include contributions from seven skull bones
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_14){: .autogenerated-content}). The frontal
bone forms the roof and the zygomatic bone forms the lateral wall and
lateral floor. The medial floor is primarily formed by the maxilla, with
a small contribution from the palatine bone. The ethmoid bone and
lacrimal bone make up much of the medial wall and the sphenoid bone
forms the posterior orbit.
{: #fs-id1887927}

At the posterior apex of the orbit is the opening of the <span
data-type="term">optic canal</span>, which allows for passage of the
optic nerve from the retina to the brain. Lateral to this is the
elongated and irregularly shaped superior orbital fissure, which
provides passage for the artery that supplies the eyeball, sensory

movements.

# The Nasal Septum and Nasal Conchae

The <span data-type="term">nasal septum</span> consists of both bone and
cartilage components ([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_15){:
.autogenerated-content}; see also [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_09){:
.autogenerated-content}). The upper portion of the septum is formed by
the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The lower and posterior
parts of the septum are formed by the triangular-shaped vomer bone. In
an anterior view of the skull, the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid
bone is easily seen inside the nasal opening as the upper nasal septum,
but only a small portion of the vomer is seen as the inferior septum. A
better view of the vomer bone is seen when looking into the posterior
nasal cavity with an inferior view of the skull, where the vomer forms
the full height of the nasal septum. The anterior nasal septum is formed
by the <span data-type="term">septal cartilage</span>, a flexible plate
that fills in the gap between the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and
vomer bones. This cartilage also extends outward into the nose where it
separates the right and left nostrils. The septal cartilage is not found
in the dry skull.
{: #fs-id2125356}

Attached to the lateral wall on each side of the nasal cavity are the
superior, middle, and inferior <span data-type="term">nasal
conchae</span> (singular = concha), which are named for their positions
(see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_11){: .autogenerated-content}). These are
bony plates that curve downward as they project into the space of the
nasal cavity. They serve to swirl the incoming air, which helps to warm
and moisturize it before the air moves into the delicate air sacs of the
lungs. This also allows mucus, secreted by the tissue lining the nasal
cavity, to trap incoming dust, pollen, bacteria, and viruses. The
largest of the conchae is the inferior nasal concha, which is an
independent bone of the skull. The middle concha and the superior
conchae, which is the smallest, are both formed by the ethmoid bone.
When looking into the anterior nasal opening of the skull, only the
inferior and middle conchae can be seen. The small superior nasal concha
is well hidden above and behind the middle concha.

is divided at the midline into right and left areas by a significant
bony structure or opening.
{: #fs-id2152311}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1921505" markdown="1">
## Anterior Cranial Fossa
{: data-type="title"}

The anterior cranial fossa is the most anterior and the shallowest of
the three cranial fossae. It overlies the orbits and contains the
frontal lobes of the brain. Anteriorly, the anterior fossa is bounded by
the frontal bone, which also forms the majority of the floor for this
space. The lesser wings of the sphenoid bone form the prominent ledge
that marks the boundary between the anterior and middle cranial fossae.
Located in the floor of the anterior cranial fossa at the midline is a
portion of the ethmoid bone, consisting of the upward projecting crista
galli and to either side of this, the cribriform plates.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2058871" markdown="1">
## Middle Cranial Fossa
{: data-type="title"}

The middle cranial fossa is deeper and situated posterior to the
anterior fossa. It extends from the lesser wings of the sphenoid bone
anteriorly, to the petrous ridges (petrous portion of the temporal
bones) posteriorly. The large, diagonally positioned petrous ridges give
the middle cranial fossa a butterfly shape, making it narrow at the
midline and broad laterally. The temporal lobes of the brain occupy this
fossa. The middle cranial fossa is divided at the midline by the upward
bony prominence of the sella turcica, a part of the sphenoid bone. The
middle cranial fossa has several openings for the passage of blood
vessels and cranial nerves (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_06){:
.autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1838522}

Openings in the middle cranial fossa are as follows:
{: #fs-id2070380}

* <span data-type="term">Optic canal</span>—This opening is located at
  the anterior lateral corner of the sella turcica. It provides for
  passage of the optic nerve into the orbit.
* <span data-type="term">Superior orbital fissure</span>—This large,
  irregular opening into the posterior orbit is located on the anterior
  wall of the middle cranial fossa, lateral to the optic canal and under
  the projecting margin of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. Nerves
  to the eyeball and associated muscles, and sensory nerves to the
  forehead pass through this opening.
* <span data-type="term">Foramen rotundum</span>—This rounded opening
  (rotundum = “round”) is located in the floor of the middle cranial
  fossa, just inferior to the superior orbital fissure. It is the exit
  point for a major sensory nerve that supplies the cheek, nose, and
  upper teeth.
* <span data-type="term">Foramen ovale of the middle cranial
  fossa</span>—This large, oval-shaped opening in the floor of the
  middle cranial fossa provides passage for a major sensory nerve to the
  lateral head, cheek, chin, and lower teeth.
* <span data-type="term">Foramen spinosum</span>—This small opening,
  located posterior-lateral to the foramen ovale, is the entry point for
  an important artery that supplies the covering layers surrounding the
  brain. The branching pattern of this artery forms readily visible
  grooves on the internal surface of the skull and these grooves can be
  traced back to their origin at the foramen spinosum.
* <span data-type="term">Carotid canal</span>—This is the zig-zag
  passageway through which a major artery to the brain enters the skull.
  The entrance to the carotid canal is located on the inferior aspect of
  the skull, anteromedial to the styloid process (see
  [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_06){: .autogenerated-content}**a**{:
  data-effect="bold"}). From here, the canal runs anteromedially within
  the bony base of the skull. Just above the foramen lacerum, the
  carotid canal opens into the middle cranial cavity, near the
  posterior-lateral base of the sella turcica.
* <span data-type="term">Foramen lacerum</span>—This irregular opening
  is located in the base of the skull, immediately inferior to the exit
  of the carotid canal. This opening is an artifact of the dry skull,
  because in life it is completely filled with cartilage. All the
  openings of the skull that provide for passage of nerves or blood
  vessels have smooth margins; the word lacerum (“ragged” or “torn”)
  tells us that this opening has ragged edges and thus nothing passes
  through it.

## Posterior Cranial Fossa
{: data-type="title"}

The posterior cranial fossa is the most posterior and deepest portion of
the cranial cavity. It contains the cerebellum of the brain. The
posterior fossa is bounded anteriorly by the petrous ridges, while the
occipital bone forms the floor and posterior wall. It is divided at the
midline by the large foramen magnum (“great aperture”), the opening that
provides for passage of the spinal cord.
{: #fs-id1489044}

Located on the medial wall of the petrous ridge in the posterior cranial
fossa is the internal acoustic meatus (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_09){:
.autogenerated-content}). This opening provides for passage of the nerve
from the hearing and equilibrium organs of the inner ear, and the nerve
that supplies the muscles of the face. Located at the anterior-lateral
margin of the foramen magnum is the <span data-type="term">hypoglossal
canal</span>. These emerge on the inferior aspect of the skull at the
base of the occipital condyle and provide passage for an important nerve
to the tongue.
{: #fs-id1724550}

Immediately inferior to the internal acoustic meatus is the large,
irregularly shaped <span data-type="term">jugular foramen</span> (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_06){: .autogenerated-content}**a**{:
data-effect="bold"}). Several cranial nerves from the brain exit the
skull via this opening. It is also the exit point through the base of
the skull for all the venous return blood leaving the brain. The venous
structures that carry blood inside the skull form large, curved grooves
on the inner walls of the posterior cranial fossa, which terminate at
each jugular foramen.

# Paranasal Sinuses
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">paranasal sinuses</span> are hollow,
air-filled spaces located within certain bones of the skull
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_16){: .autogenerated-content}). All of the
sinuses communicate with the nasal cavity (paranasal = “next to nasal
cavity”) and are lined with nasal mucosa. They serve to reduce bone mass
and thus lighten the skull, and they also add resonance to the voice.
This second feature is most obvious when you have a cold or sinus
congestion. These produce swelling of the mucosa and excess mucus
production, which can obstruct the narrow passageways between the
sinuses and the nasal cavity, causing your voice to sound different to
yourself and others. This blockage can also allow the sinuses to fill
with fluid, with the resulting pressure producing pain and discomfort.
{: #fs-id1977054}

The paranasal sinuses are named for the skull bone that each occupies.
The <span data-type="term">frontal sinus</span> is located just above
the eyebrows, within the frontal bone (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_15){:
.autogenerated-content}). This irregular space may be divided at the
midline into bilateral spaces, or these may be fused into a single sinus
space. The frontal sinus is the most anterior of the paranasal sinuses.
The largest sinus is the <span data-type="term">maxillary sinus</span>.
These are paired and located within the right and left maxillary bones,
where they occupy the area just below the orbits. The maxillary sinuses
are most commonly involved during sinus infections. Because their
connection to the nasal cavity is located high on their medial wall,
they are difficult to drain. The <span data-type="term">sphenoid
sinus</span> is a single, midline sinus. It is located within the body
of the sphenoid bone, just anterior and inferior to the sella turcica,
thus making it the most posterior of the paranasal sinuses. The lateral
aspects of the ethmoid bone contain multiple small spaces separated by
very thin bony walls. Each of these spaces is called an <span
data-type="term">ethmoid air cell</span>. These are located on both
sides of the ethmoid bone, between the upper nasal cavity and medial
orbit, just behind the superior nasal conchae.

# Hyoid Bone
{: data-type="title"}

The hyoid bone is an independent bone that does not contact any other
bone and thus is not part of the skull ([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_02_17){:
.autogenerated-content}). It is a small U-shaped bone located in the
upper neck near the level of the inferior mandible, with the tips of the
“U” pointing posteriorly. The hyoid serves as the base for the tongue
above, and is attached to the larynx below and the pharynx posteriorly.
The hyoid is held in position by a series of small muscles that attach
to it either from above or below. These muscles act to move the hyoid
up/down or forward/back. Movements of the hyoid are coordinated with
movements of the tongue, larynx, and pharynx during swallowing and
speaking.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The skull consists of the brain case and the facial bones. The brain
case surrounds and protects the brain, which occupies the cranial cavity
inside the skull. It consists of the rounded calvaria and a complex
base. The brain case is formed by eight bones, the paired parietal and
temporal bones plus the unpaired frontal, occipital, sphenoid, and
ethmoid bones. The narrow gap between the bones is filled with dense,
fibrous connective tissue that unites the bones. The sagittal suture
joins the right and left parietal bones. The coronal suture joins the
parietal bones to the frontal bone, the lamboid suture joins them to the
occipital bone, and the squamous suture joins them to the temporal bone.
{: #fs-id2227615}

The facial bones support the facial structures and form the upper and
lower jaws. These consist of 14 bones, with the paired maxillary,
palatine, zygomatic, nasal, lacrimal, and inferior conchae bones and the
unpaired vomer and mandible bones. The ethmoid bone also contributes to
the formation of facial structures. The maxilla forms the upper jaw and
the mandible forms the lower jaw. The maxilla also forms the larger
anterior portion of the hard palate, which is completed by the smaller
palatine bones that form the posterior portion of the hard palate.
{: #fs-id2036692}

The floor of the cranial cavity increases in depth from front to back
and is divided into three cranial fossae. The anterior cranial fossa is
located between the frontal bone and lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. A
small area of the ethmoid bone, consisting of the crista galli and
cribriform plates, is located at the midline of this fossa. The middle
cranial fossa extends from the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone to the
petrous ridge (petrous portion of temporal bone). The right and left
sides are separated at the midline by the sella turcica, which surrounds
the shallow hypophyseal fossa. Openings through the skull in the floor
of the middle fossa include the optic canal and superior orbital
fissure, which open into the posterior orbit, the foramen rotundum,
foramen ovale, and foramen spinosum, and the exit of the carotid canal
with its underlying foramen lacerum. The deep posterior cranial fossa
extends from the petrous ridge to the occipital bone. Openings here
include the large foramen magnum, plus the internal acoustic meatus,
jugular foramina, and hypoglossal canals. Additional openings located on
the external base of the skull include the stylomastoid foramen and the
entrance to the carotid canal.
{: #fs-id1416074}

The anterior skull has the orbits that house the eyeballs and associated
muscles. The walls of the orbit are formed by contributions from seven
bones: the frontal, zygomatic, maxillary, palatine, ethmoid, lacrimal,
and sphenoid. Located at the superior margin of the orbit is the
supraorbital foramen, and below the orbit is the infraorbital foramen.
The mandible has two openings, the mandibular foramen on its inner
surface and the mental foramen on its external surface near the chin.
The nasal conchae are bony projections from the lateral walls of the
nasal cavity. The large inferior nasal concha is an independent bone,
while the middle and superior conchae are parts of the ethmoid bone. The
nasal septum is formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone,
the vomer bone, and the septal cartilage. The paranasal sinuses are
air-filled spaces located within the frontal, maxillary, sphenoid, and
ethmoid bones.
{: #fs-id1972638}

On the lateral skull, the zygomatic arch consists of two parts, the
temporal process of the zygomatic bone anteriorly and the zygomatic
process of the temporal bone posteriorly. The temporal fossa is the
shallow space located on the lateral skull above the level of the
zygomatic arch. The infratemporal fossa is located below the zygomatic
arch and deep to the ramus of the mandible.
{: #fs-id1372749}

The hyoid bone is located in the upper neck and does not join with any
other bone. It is held in position by muscles and serves to support the
tongue above, the larynx below, and the pharynx posteriorly.
