* Describe the location and structure of the pineal gland
* Discuss the function of melatonin

Recall that the hypothalamus, part of the diencephalon of the brain,
sits inferior and somewhat anterior to the thalamus. Inferior but
somewhat posterior to the thalamus is the <span data-type="term">pineal
gland</span>, a tiny endocrine gland whose functions are not entirely
clear. The <span data-type="term">pinealocyte</span> cells that make up
the pineal gland are known to produce and secrete the amine hormone
<span data-type="term">melatonin</span>, which is derived from
serotonin.

The secretion of melatonin varies according to the level of light
received from the environment. When photons of light stimulate the
retinas of the eyes, a nerve impulse is sent to a region of the
hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is
important in regulating biological rhythms. From the SCN, the nerve
signal is carried to the spinal cord and eventually to the pineal gland,
where the production of melatonin is inhibited. As a result, blood
levels of melatonin fall, promoting wakefulness. In contrast, as light
levels decline—such as during the evening—melatonin production
increases, boosting blood levels and causing drowsiness.

The secretion of melatonin may influence the body’s circadian rhythms,
the dark-light fluctuations that affect not only sleepiness and
wakefulness, but also appetite and body temperature. Interestingly,
children have higher melatonin levels than adults, which may prevent the
release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary, thereby inhibiting
the onset of puberty. Finally, an antioxidant role of melatonin is the
subject of current research.

Jet lag occurs when a person travels across several time zones and feels
sleepy during the day or wakeful at night. Traveling across multiple
time zones significantly disturbs the light-dark cycle regulated by
melatonin. It can take up to several days for melatonin synthesis to
adjust to the light-dark patterns in the new environment, resulting in
jet lag. Some air travelers take melatonin supplements to induce sleep.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The pineal gland is an endocrine structure of the diencephalon of the
brain, and is located inferior and posterior to the thalamus. It is made
up of pinealocytes. These cells produce and secrete the hormone
melatonin in response to low light levels. High blood levels of
melatonin induce drowsiness. Jet lag, caused by traveling across several
time zones, occurs because melatonin synthesis takes several days to
readjust to the light-dark patterns in the new environment.

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a mood disorder characterized by,
among other symptoms, increased appetite, sluggishness, and increased
sleepiness. It occurs most commonly during the winter months, especially
in regions with long winter nights. Propose a role for melatonin in SAD
and a possible non-drug therapy.
{: #fs-id1398292}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id849154" data-label="" markdown="1">
SAD is thought to occur in part because low levels and duration of
sunlight allow excessive and prolonged secretion of melatonin. Light
therapy—daytime exposure to very bright lighting—is one common therapy.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a disease that causes deterioration of the

levels.

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id801955" data-label="" markdown="1">
The retina is important for melatonin production because it senses
light. Bright light inhibits the production of melatonin, whereas low
light levels promote the production of melatonin. Therefore,
deterioration of the retinas would most likely disturb the sleep-wake
pattern because melatonin production would be elevated.
