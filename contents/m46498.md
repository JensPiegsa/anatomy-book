  location, and actions of various muscles

The Greeks and Romans conducted the first studies done on the human body
in Western culture. The educated class of subsequent societies studied
Latin and Greek, and therefore the early pioneers of anatomy continued
to apply Latin and Greek terminology or roots when they named the
skeletal muscles. The large number of muscles in the body and unfamiliar
words can make learning the names of the muscles in the body seem
daunting, but understanding the etymology can help. Etymology is the
study of how the root of a particular word entered a language and how
the use of the word evolved over time. Taking the time to learn the root
of the words is crucial to understanding the vocabulary of anatomy and
physiology. When you understand the names of muscles it will help you
remember where the muscles are located and what they do
([\[link\]](#fig-ch11_02_01){: .autogenerated-content},
[\[link\]](#fig-ch11_02_02){: .autogenerated-content}, and
[\[link\]](#tbl-ch11_02){: .autogenerated-content}). Pronunciation of
words and terms will take a bit of time to master, but after you have
some basic information; the correct names and pronunciations will become
easier.

![This table shows two examples of muscle names and how to translate them based on their Latin roots. The first row uses abductor digiti minimi as an example. The word abductor comes from the Latin roots ab, which means away from, and duct, which means to move. Therefore an abductor is a muscle that moves away from something. The word digiti comes from the Latin root digititus, which means digit and refers to a finger or toe. The word minimi comes from the Latin root minimus, which means minimum, tiny, or little. Therefore, the abductor digiti minimi is a muscle that moves the little finger or toe away. The second row uses the adductor digiti minimi as an example. The word adductor comes from the Latin root ad, which means to or toward, and duct, which means to move. Therefore an adductor is a muscle that moves toward something. As with the abductor digiti minimi, digiti refers to a finger or toe and minimi refers to something that is little. Therefore the adductor digiti minimi is a muscle that moves the little finger or toe forward.](../resources/1126_Understand_A_Muscle_from_the_Latin.jpg){: #fig-ch11_02_02 data-media-type="image/jpg" data-title="Understanding a Muscle Name from the Latin "}

each of which describes the muscle in some way. These include naming the
muscle after its shape, its size compared to other muscles in the area,
its location in the body or the location of its attachments to the
skeleton, how many origins it has, or its action.

The skeletal muscle’s anatomical location or its relationship to a
particular bone often determines its name. For example, the frontalis
muscle is located on top of the frontal bone of the skull. Similarly,
the shapes of some muscles are very distinctive and the names, such as
orbicularis, reflect the shape. For the buttocks, the size of the
muscles influences the names: gluteus <span
data-type="term">maximus</span> (largest), gluteus <span
data-type="term">medius</span> (medium), and the gluteus <span
data-type="term">minimus</span> (smallest). Names were given to indicate
length—<span data-type="term">brevis</span> (short), <span
data-type="term">longus</span> (long)—and to identify position relative
to the midline: <span data-type="term">lateralis</span> (to the outside
away from the midline), and <span data-type="term">medialis</span>
(toward the midline). The direction of the muscle fibers and fascicles
are used to describe muscles relative to the midline, such as the <span
data-type="term">rectus</span> (straight) abdominis, or the <span
data-type="term">oblique</span> (at an angle) muscles of the abdomen.

Some muscle names indicate the number of muscles in a group. One example
of this is the quadriceps, a group of four muscles located on the
anterior (front) thigh. Other muscle names can provide information as to
how many origins a particular muscle has, such as the biceps brachii.
The prefix <span data-type="term">bi</span> indicates that the muscle
has two origins and <span data-type="term">tri</span> indicates three
origins.

The location of a muscle’s attachment can also appear in its name. When
the name of a muscle is based on the attachments, the origin is always
named first. For instance, the sternocleidomastoid muscle of the neck
has a dual origin on the sternum (sterno) and clavicle (cleido), and it
inserts on the mastoid process of the temporal bone. The last feature by
which to name a muscle is its action. When muscles are named for the
movement they produce, one can find action words in their name. Some
examples are <span data-type="term">flexor</span> (decreases the angle
at the joint), <span data-type="term">extensor</span> (increases the
angle at the joint), <span data-type="term">abductor</span> (moves the
bone away from the midline), or <span data-type="term">adductor</span>
(moves the bone toward the midline).

# Chapter Review

Muscle names are based on many characteristics. The location of a muscle
in the body is important. Some muscles are named based on their size and
location, such as the gluteal muscles of the buttocks. Other muscle
names can indicate the location in the body or bones with which the
muscle is associated, such as the tibialis anterior. The shapes of some
muscles are distinctive; for example, the direction of the muscle fibers
is used to describe muscles of the body midline. The origin and/or
insertion can also be features used to name a muscle; examples are the
biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and the pectoralis major.

# Critical Thinking Questions

<div data-type="exercise">
<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
Describe the different criteria that contribute to how skeletal muscles
are named.

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
In anatomy and physiology, many word roots are Latin or Greek. Portions,
or roots, of the word give us clues about the function, shape, action,
or location of a muscle.
