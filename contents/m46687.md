The <span data-type="term">parathyroid glands</span> are tiny, round
structures usually found embedded in the posterior surface of the
thyroid gland ([\[link\]](#fig-ch18_05_01){: .autogenerated-content}). A
thick connective tissue capsule separates the glands from the thyroid
tissue. Most people have four parathyroid glands, but occasionally there
are more in tissues of the neck or chest. The function of one type of
parathyroid cells, the oxyphil cells, is not clear. The primary
functional cells of the parathyroid glands are the chief cells. These
epithelial cells produce and secrete the <span
data-type="term">parathyroid hormone (PTH)</span>, the major hormone
involved in the regulation of blood calcium levels.

The parathyroid glands produce and secrete PTH, a peptide hormone, in
response to low blood calcium levels ([\[link\]](#fig-ch18_05_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). PTH secretion causes the release of calcium
from the bones by stimulating osteoclasts, which secrete enzymes that
degrade bone and release calcium into the interstitial fluid. PTH also
inhibits osteoblasts, the cells involved in bone deposition, thereby
sparing blood calcium. PTH causes increased reabsorption of calcium (and
magnesium) in the kidney tubules from the urine filtrate. In addition,
PTH initiates the production of the steroid hormone calcitriol (also
known as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), which is the active form of vitamin
D<sub>3</sub>, in the kidneys. Calcitriol then stimulates increased
absorption of dietary calcium by the intestines. A negative feedback
loop regulates the levels of PTH, with rising blood calcium levels
inhibiting further release of PTH.

Parathyroid Hormone in Maintaining Blood Calcium Homeostasis
</div>
<figcaption>
Parathyroid hormone increases blood calcium levels when they drop too
low. Conversely, calcitonin, which is released from the thyroid gland,
decreases blood calcium levels when they become too high. These two
mechanisms constantly maintain blood calcium concentration at
homeostasis.
</figcaption>
<span markdown="1" data-type="media" id="fs-id1355324" data-alt="This diagram shows
the role of parathyroid hormone in maintaining blood calcium
homeostasis. When blood calcium concentration drops, chief cells of the
parathyroid gland release parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH affects bone,
the kidneys and the intestines. In regards to bone, PTH inhibits
osteoblasts and stimulates osteoclasts. This results in compact bone
being broken down, as illustrated by an osteoclast burrowing into the
surface of a bone. The break down releases calcium ions into a nearby
blood vessel. The osteoblasts are inactive in this stage. In regards to
the kidneys, PTH stimulates kidney tubule cells to recover waste calcium
from the urine. PTH also stimulates kidney tubule cells to release
calcitrol. This is illustrated with a cross section of a kidney tubule,
showing the cells of the tubule wall. Urine is running to the left of
the tubule wall cells while an artery is to the right. The right edge of
the tubule wall cells and the left edge of the artery are separated by a
small region of interstitial space. The cells are removing calcium from
the urine and pumping it into the interstitial fluid, after which the
calcium enters the artery. The cells are also pumping calcitrol into the
blood vessel. In regards to the intestine, PTH stimulates the intestines
to absorb calcium from digesting food. A cross section of an intestinal
cell is shown, which is cube-shaped but with finger-like projections on
the intestinal lumen side (top). Beneath the intestinal cell is an
artery. Calcitrol is leaving the artery and entering the intestinal
cell, stimulating it to absorb calcium from food in the intestinal
lumen. The effects of PTH on bone, the kidneys and the intestines all
cause blood calcium levels to increase. High calcium concentrations in
the blood stimulate the parafollicular cells in the thyroid to release
calcitonin. Calcitonin reverses the effects of PTH by stimulating
osteoblasts and inhibiting osteoclasts in bone tissue. This is
illustrated by calcium ions leaving a blood vessel and traveling to
osteoblasts on a section of compact bone. The osteoblasts are thickening
the compact bone layer while, in this stage, the osteoclasts are
inactive."> ![This diagram shows the role of parathyroid hormone in

Abnormally high activity of the parathyroid gland can cause <span
data-type="term">hyperparathyroidism</span>, a disorder caused by an
overproduction of PTH that results in excessive calcium reabsorption
from bone. Hyperparathyroidism can significantly decrease bone density,
leading to spontaneous fractures or deformities. As blood calcium levels
rise, cell membrane permeability to sodium is decreased, and the
responsiveness of the nervous system is reduced. At the same time,
calcium deposits may collect in the body’s tissues and organs, impairing
their functioning.
{: #fs-id1279317}

In contrast, abnormally low blood calcium levels may be caused by
parathyroid hormone deficiency, called <span
data-type="term">hypoparathyroidism</span>, which may develop following
injury or surgery involving the thyroid gland. Low blood calcium
increases membrane permeability to sodium, resulting in muscle
twitching, cramping, spasms, or convulsions. Severe deficits can
paralyze muscles, including those involved in breathing, and can be
fatal.
{: #fs-id1475434}

When blood calcium levels are high, calcitonin is produced and secreted
by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. As discussed earlier,
calcitonin inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, reduces the absorption
of dietary calcium in the intestine, and signals the kidneys to reabsorb
less calcium, resulting in larger amounts of calcium excreted in the
urine.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Calcium is required for a variety of important physiologic processes,
including neuromuscular functioning; thus, blood calcium levels are
closely regulated. The parathyroid glands are small structures located
on the posterior thyroid gland that produce parathyroid hormone (PTH),
which regulates blood calcium levels. Low blood calcium levels cause the
production and secretion of PTH. In contrast, elevated blood calcium
levels inhibit secretion of PTH and trigger secretion of the thyroid
hormone calcitonin. Underproduction of PTH can result in
hypoparathyroidism. In contrast, overproduction of PTH can result in
hyperparathyroidism.

The production and secretion of PTH is regulated by a negative feedback
loop. Low blood calcium levels initiate the production and secretion of
PTH. PTH increases bone resorption, calcium absorption from the
intestines, and calcium reabsorption by the kidneys. As a result, blood
calcium levels begin to rise. This, in turn, inhibits the further
production and secretion of PTH.

they are referred to as kidney stones.
