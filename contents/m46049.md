By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Identify and distinguish between the types of connective tissue:
  proper, supportive, and fluid
* Explain the functions of connective tissues

</div>
As may be obvious from its name, one of the major functions of
connective tissue is to connect tissues and organs. Unlike epithelial
tissue, which is composed of cells closely packed with little or no
extracellular space in between, connective tissue cells are dispersed in
a <span data-type="term">matrix</span>. The matrix usually includes a
large amount of extracellular material produced by the connective tissue
cells that are embedded within it. The matrix plays a major role in the
functioning of this tissue. The major component of the matrix is a <span
data-type="term">ground substance</span> often crisscrossed by protein
fibers. This ground substance is usually a fluid, but it can also be
mineralized and solid, as in bones. Connective tissues come in a vast
variety of forms, yet they typically have in common three characteristic
components: cells, large amounts of amorphous ground substance, and
protein fibers. The amount and structure of each component correlates
with the function of the tissue, from the rigid ground substance in
bones supporting the body to the inclusion of specialized cells; for
example, a phagocytic cell that engulfs pathogens and also rids tissue
of cellular debris.

# Functions of Connective Tissues
{: data-type="title"}

Connective tissues perform many functions in the body, but most
importantly, they support and connect other tissues; from the connective
tissue sheath that surrounds muscle cells, to the tendons that attach
muscles to bones, and to the skeleton that supports the positions of the
body. Protection is another major function of connective tissue, in the
form of fibrous capsules and bones that protect delicate organs and, of
course, the skeletal system. Specialized cells in connective tissue
defend the body from microorganisms that enter the body. Transport of
fluid, nutrients, waste, and chemical messengers is ensured by
specialized fluid connective tissues, such as blood and lymph. Adipose
cells store surplus energy in the form of fat and contribute to the
thermal insulation of the body.

# Embryonic Connective Tissue
{: data-type="title"}

All connective tissues derive from the mesodermal layer of the embryo
(see [\[link\]](/m46046#fig-ch04_01_02){: .autogenerated-content}). The
first connective tissue to develop in the embryo is <span
data-type="term">mesenchyme</span>, the stem cell line from which all
connective tissues are later derived. Clusters of mesenchymal cells are
scattered throughout adult tissue and supply the cells needed for
replacement and repair after a connective tissue injury. A second type
of embryonic connective tissue forms in the umbilical cord, called <span
data-type="term">mucous connective tissue</span> or Wharton’s jelly.
This tissue is no longer present after birth, leaving only scattered
mesenchymal cells throughout the body.

# Classification of Connective Tissues
{: data-type="title"}

The three broad categories of connective tissue are classified according
to the characteristics of their ground substance and the types of fibers
found within the matrix ([\[link\]](#tbl-ch04_03_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). <span data-type="term">Connective tissue
proper</span> includes <span data-type="term">loose connective
tissue</span> and <span data-type="term">dense connective tissue</span>.
Both tissues have a variety of cell types and protein fibers suspended
in a viscous ground substance. Dense connective tissue is reinforced by
bundles of fibers that provide tensile strength, elasticity, and
protection. In loose connective tissue, the fibers are loosely
organized, leaving large spaces in between. <span
data-type="term">Supportive connective tissue</span>—bone and
cartilage—provide structure and strength to the body and protect soft
tissues. A few distinct cell types and densely packed fibers in a matrix
characterize these tissues. In bone, the matrix is rigid and described
as calcified because of the deposited calcium salts. In <span
data-type="term">fluid connective tissue</span>, in other words, lymph
and blood, various specialized cells circulate in a watery fluid
containing salts, nutrients, and dissolved proteins.

# Connective Tissue Proper
{: data-type="title"}

Fibroblasts are present in all connective tissue proper
([\[link\]](#fig-ch04_03_01){: .autogenerated-content}). Fibrocytes,
adipocytes, and mesenchymal cells are fixed cells, which means they
remain within the connective tissue. Other cells move in and out of the
connective tissue in response to chemical signals. Macrophages, mast
cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and phagocytic cells are found in
connective tissue proper but are actually part of the immune system
protecting the body.

## Cell Types
{: data-type="title"}

The most abundant cell in connective tissue proper is the <span
data-type="term">fibroblast</span>. Polysaccharides and proteins
secreted by fibroblasts combine with extra-cellular fluids to produce a
viscous ground substance that, with embedded fibrous proteins, forms the
extra-cellular matrix. As you might expect, a <span
data-type="term">fibrocyte</span>, a less active form of fibroblast, is
the second most common cell type in connective tissue proper.
{: #fs-id1508104}

<span data-type="term">Adipocytes</span> are cells that store lipids as
droplets that fill most of the cytoplasm. There are two basic types of
adipocytes: white and brown. The brown adipocytes store lipids as many
droplets, and have high metabolic activity. In contrast, white fat
adipocytes store lipids as a single large drop and are metabolically
less active. Their effectiveness at storing large amounts of fat is
witnessed in obese individuals. The number and type of adipocytes
depends on the tissue and location, and vary among individuals in the
population.
{: #fs-id1174906}

The <span data-type="term">mesenchymal cell</span> is a multipotent
adult stem cell. These cells can differentiate into any type of
connective tissue cells needed for repair and healing of damaged tissue.
{: #fs-id1183443}

The macrophage cell is a large cell derived from a monocyte, a type of
blood cell, which enters the connective tissue matrix from the blood
vessels. The macrophage cells are an essential component of the immune
system, which is the body’s defense against potential pathogens and
degraded host cells. When stimulated, macrophages release cytokines,
small proteins that act as chemical messengers. Cytokines recruit other
cells of the immune system to infected sites and stimulate their
activities. Roaming, or free, macrophages move rapidly by amoeboid
movement, engulfing infectious agents and cellular debris. In contrast,
fixed macrophages are permanent residents of their tissues.
{: #fs-id1087946}

The mast cell, found in connective tissue proper, has many cytoplasmic
granules. These granules contain the chemical signals histamine and
heparin. When irritated or damaged, mast cells release histamine, an
inflammatory mediator, which causes vasodilation and increased blood
flow at a site of injury or infection, along with itching, swelling, and
redness you recognize as an allergic response. Like blood cells, mast
cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells and are part of the
immune system.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1126733" markdown="1">
## Connective Tissue Fibers and Ground Substance
{: data-type="title"}

Three main types of fibers are secreted by fibroblasts: collagen fibers,
elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. <span data-type="term">Collagen
fiber</span> is made from fibrous protein subunits linked together to
form a long and straight fiber. Collagen fibers, while flexible, have
great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and
tendons their characteristic resilience and strength. These fibers hold
connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body.
{: #fs-id1303675}

<span data-type="term">Elastic fiber</span> contains the protein elastin
along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main
property of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will
return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are prominent in elastic
tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column.
{: #fs-id1139219}

<span data-type="term">Reticular fiber</span> is also formed from the
same protein subunits as collagen fibers; however, these fibers remain
narrow and are arrayed in a branching network. They are found throughout
the body, but are most abundant in the reticular tissue of soft organs,
such as liver and spleen, where they anchor and provide structural
support to the <span data-type="term">parenchyma</span> (the functional
cells, blood vessels, and nerves of the organ).
{: #fs-id1205809}

All of these fiber types are embedded in ground substance. Secreted by
fibroblasts, ground substance is made of polysaccharides, specifically
hyaluronic acid, and proteins. These combine to form a proteoglycan with
a protein core and polysaccharide branches. The proteoglycan attracts
and traps available moisture forming the clear, viscous, colorless
matrix you now know as ground substance.
{: #fs-id1082522}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1139056" markdown="1">
## Loose Connective Tissue
{: data-type="title"}

Loose connective tissue is found between many organs where it acts both
to absorb shock and bind tissues together. It allows water, salts, and
various nutrients to diffuse through to adjacent or imbedded cells and
tissues.
{: #fs-id1138718}

<span data-type="term">Adipose tissue</span> consists mostly of fat
storage cells, with little extracellular matrix
([\[link\]](#fig-ch04_03_02){: .autogenerated-content}). A large number
of capillaries allow rapid storage and mobilization of lipid molecules.
White adipose tissue is most abundant. It can appear yellow and owes its
color to carotene and related pigments from plant food. White fat
contributes mostly to lipid storage and can serve as insulation from
cold temperatures and mechanical injuries. White adipose tissue can be
found protecting the kidneys and cushioning the back of the eye. Brown
adipose tissue is more common in infants, hence the term “baby fat.” In
adults, there is a reduced amount of brown fat and it is found mainly in
the neck and clavicular regions of the body. The many mitochondria in
the cytoplasm of brown adipose tissue help explain its efficiency at
metabolizing stored fat. Brown adipose tissue is thermogenic, meaning
that as it breaks down fats, it releases metabolic heat, rather than
producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a key molecule used in
metabolism.

## Dense Connective Tissue
{: data-type="title"}

Dense connective tissue contains more collagen fibers than does loose
connective tissue. As a consequence, it displays greater resistance to
stretching. There are two major categories of dense connective tissue:
regular and irregular. Dense regular connective tissue fibers are
parallel to each other, enhancing tensile strength and resistance to
stretching in the direction of the fiber orientations. Ligaments and
tendons are made of dense regular connective tissue, but in ligaments
not all fibers are parallel. Dense regular elastic tissue contains
elastin fibers in addition to collagen fibers, which allows the ligament
to return to its original length after stretching. The ligaments in the
vocal folds and between the vertebrae in the vertebral column are
elastic.
{: #fs-id1180376}

In dense irregular connective tissue, the direction of fibers is random.
This arrangement gives the tissue greater strength in all directions and
less strength in one particular direction. In some tissues, fibers
crisscross and form a mesh. In other tissues, stretching in several
directions is achieved by alternating layers where fibers run in the
same orientation in each layer, and it is the layers themselves that are
stacked at an angle. The dermis of the skin is an example of dense
irregular connective tissue rich in collagen fibers. Dense irregular
elastic tissues give arterial walls the strength and the ability to
regain original shape after stretching ([\[link\]](#fig-ch04_03_04){:

opponent stands ready as you prepare to hit the serve, but you are
confident that you will smash the ball past your opponent. As you toss
the ball high in the air, a burning pain shoots across your wrist and
you drop the tennis racket. That dull ache in the wrist that you ignored
through the summer is now an unbearable pain. The game is over for now.
{: #fs-id1465397}

After examining your swollen wrist, the doctor in the emergency room
announces that you have developed wrist tendinitis. She recommends icing
the tender area, taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to
ease the pain and to reduce swelling, and complete rest for a few weeks.
She interrupts your protests that you cannot stop playing. She issues a
stern warning about the risk of aggravating the condition and the
possibility of surgery. She consoles you by mentioning that well known
tennis players such as Venus and Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal have
also suffered from tendinitis related injuries.
{: #fs-id1315168}

What is tendinitis and how did it happen? Tendinitis is the inflammation
of a tendon, the thick band of fibrous connective tissue that attaches a
muscle to a bone. The condition causes pain and tenderness in the area
around a joint. On rare occasions, a sudden serious injury will cause
tendinitis. Most often, the condition results from repetitive motions
over time that strain the tendons needed to perform the tasks.
{: #fs-id1516014}

Persons whose jobs and hobbies involve performing the same movements
over and over again are often at the greatest risk of tendinitis. You
hear of tennis and golfer’s elbow, jumper\'s knee, and swimmer’s
shoulder. In all cases, overuse of the joint causes a microtrauma that
initiates the inflammatory response. Tendinitis is routinely diagnosed
through a clinical examination. In case of severe pain, X-rays can be
examined to rule out the possibility of a bone injury. Severe cases of
tendinitis can even tear loose a tendon. Surgical repair of a tendon is
painful. Connective tissue in the tendon does not have abundant blood
supply and heals slowly.
{: #fs-id793704}

While older adults are at risk for tendinitis because the elasticity of
tendon tissue decreases with age, active people of all ages can develop
tendinitis. Young athletes, dancers, and computer operators; anyone who
performs the same movements constantly is at risk for tendinitis.
Although repetitive motions are unavoidable in many activities and may
lead to tendinitis, precautions can be taken that can lessen the
probability of developing tendinitis. For active individuals, stretches
before exercising and cross training or changing exercises are
recommended. For the passionate athlete, it may be time to take some
lessons to improve technique. All of the preventive measures aim to
increase the strength of the tendon and decrease the stress put on it.
With proper rest and managed care, you will be back on the court to hit
that slice-spin serve over the net.

# Supportive Connective Tissues

Two major forms of supportive connective tissue, cartilage and bone,
allow the body to maintain its posture and protect internal organs.
{: #fs-id1460664}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1333453" markdown="1">
## Cartilage
{: data-type="title"}

The distinctive appearance of cartilage is due to polysaccharides called
chondroitin sulfates, which bind with ground substance proteins to form
proteoglycans. Embedded within the cartilage matrix are <span
data-type="term">chondrocytes</span>, or cartilage cells, and the space
they occupy are called <span data-type="term">lacunae</span> (singular =
lacuna). A layer of dense irregular connective tissue, the
perichondrium, encapsulates the cartilage. Cartilaginous tissue is
avascular, thus all nutrients need to diffuse through the matrix to
reach the chondrocytes. This is a factor contributing to the very slow
healing of cartilaginous tissues.
{: #fs-id1178027}

The three main types of cartilage tissue are hyaline cartilage,
fibrocartilage, and elastic cartilage ([\[link\]](#fig-ch04_03_05){:
.autogenerated-content}). <span data-type="term">Hyaline
cartilage</span>, the most common type of cartilage in the body,
consists of short and dispersed collagen fibers and contains large
amounts of proteoglycans. Under the microscope, tissue samples appear
clear. The surface of hyaline cartilage is smooth. Both strong and
flexible, it is found in the rib cage and nose and covers bones where
they meet to form moveable joints. It makes up a template of the
embryonic skeleton before bone formation. A plate of hyaline cartilage
at the ends of bone allows continued growth until adulthood. <span
data-type="term">Fibrocartilage</span> is tough because it has thick
bundles of collagen fibers dispersed through its matrix. The knee and
jaw joints and the the intervertebral discs are examples of
fibrocartilage. <span data-type="term">Elastic cartilage</span> contains
elastic fibers as well as collagen and proteoglycans. This tissue gives
rigid support as well as elasticity. Tug gently at your ear lobes, and
notice that the lobes return to their initial shape. The external ear
contains elastic cartilage.

## Bone
{: data-type="title"}

Bone is the hardest connective tissue. It provides protection to
internal organs and supports the body. Bone’s rigid extracellular matrix
contains mostly collagen fibers embedded in a mineralized ground
substance containing hydroxyapatite, a form of calcium phosphate. Both
components of the matrix, organic and inorganic, contribute to the
unusual properties of bone. Without collagen, bones would be brittle and
shatter easily. Without mineral crystals, bones would flex and provide
little support. Osteocytes, bone cells like chondrocytes, are located
within lacunae. The histology of transverse tissue from long bone shows
a typical arrangement of osteocytes in concentric circles around a
central canal. Bone is a highly vascularized tissue. Unlike cartilage,
bone tissue can recover from injuries in a relatively short time.
{: #fs-id1286153}

Cancellous bone looks like a sponge under the microscope and contains
empty spaces between trabeculae, or arches of bone proper. It is lighter
than compact bone and found in the interior of some bones and at the end
of long bones. Compact bone is solid and has greater structural
strength.

# Fluid Connective Tissue
{: data-type="title"}

Blood and lymph are fluid connective tissues. Cells circulate in a
liquid extracellular matrix. The formed elements circulating in blood
are all derived from hematopoietic stem cells located in bone marrow
([\[link\]](#fig-ch04_03_06){: .autogenerated-content}). Erythrocytes,
red blood cells, transport oxygen and some carbon dioxide. Leukocytes,
white blood cells, are responsible for defending against potentially
harmful microorganisms or molecules. Platelets are cell fragments
involved in blood clotting. Some white blood cells have the ability to
cross the endothelial layer that lines blood vessels and enter adjacent
tissues. Nutrients, salts, and wastes are dissolved in the liquid matrix
and transported through the body.
{: #fs-id1471531}

Lymph contains a liquid matrix and white blood cells. Lymphatic
capillaries are extremely permeable, allowing larger molecules and
excess fluid from interstitial spaces to enter the lymphatic vessels.
Lymph drains into blood vessels, delivering molecules to the blood that
could not otherwise directly enter the bloodstream. In this way,
specialized lymphatic capillaries transport absorbed fats away from the
intestine and deliver these molecules to the blood.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Connective tissue is a heterogeneous tissue with many cell shapes and
tissue architecture. Structurally, all connective tissues contain cells
that are embedded in an extracellular matrix stabilized by proteins. The
chemical nature and physical layout of the extracellular matrix and
proteins vary enormously among tissues, reflecting the variety of
functions that connective tissue fulfills in the body. Connective
tissues separate and cushion organs, protecting them from shifting or
traumatic injury. Connect tissues provide support and assist movement,
store and transport energy molecules, protect against infections, and
contribute to temperature homeostasis.
{: #fs-id1073343}

Many different cells contribute to the formation of connective tissues.
They originate in the mesodermal germ layer and differentiate from
mesenchyme and hematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow. Fibroblasts are
the most abundant and secrete many protein fibers, adipocytes specialize
in fat storage, hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow give rise to
all the blood cells, chondrocytes form cartilage, and osteocytes form
bone. The extracellular matrix contains fluid, proteins, polysaccharide
derivatives, and, in the case of bone, mineral crystals. Protein fibers
fall into three major groups: collagen fibers that are thick, strong,
flexible, and resist stretch; reticular fibers that are thin and form a
supportive mesh; and elastin fibers that are thin and elastic.
{: #fs-id1091806}

The major types of connective tissue are connective tissue proper,
supportive tissue, and fluid tissue. Loose connective tissue proper
includes adipose tissue, areolar tissue, and reticular tissue. These
serve to hold organs and other tissues in place and, in the case of
adipose tissue, isolate and store energy reserves. The matrix is the
most abundant feature for loose tissue although adipose tissue does not
have much extracellular matrix. Dense connective tissue proper is richer
in fibers and may be regular, with fibers oriented in parallel as in
ligaments and tendons, or irregular, with fibers oriented in several
directions. Organ capsules (collagenous type) and walls of arteries
(elastic type) contain dense irregular connective tissue. Cartilage and
bone are supportive tissue. Cartilage contains chondrocytes and is
somewhat flexible. Hyaline cartilage is smooth and clear, covers joints,
and is found in the growing portion of bones. Fibrocartilage is tough
because of extra collagen fibers and forms, among other things, the
intervertebral discs. Elastic cartilage can stretch and recoil to its
original shape because of its high content of elastic fibers. The matrix
contains very few blood vessels. Bones are made of a rigid, mineralized
matrix containing calcium salts, crystals, and osteocytes lodged in
lacunae. Bone tissue is highly vascularized. Cancellous bone is spongy
and less solid than compact bone. Fluid tissue, for example blood and
lymph, is characterized by a liquid matrix and no supporting fibers.
