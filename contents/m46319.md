Throughout this chapter, we will express embryonic and fetal ages in
terms of weeks from fertilization, commonly called conception. The
period of time required for full development of a fetus in utero is
referred to as <span data-type="term">gestation</span> (gestare = “to
carry” or “to bear”). It can be subdivided into distinct gestational
periods. The first 2 weeks of prenatal development are referred to as
the pre-embryonic stage. A developing human is referred to as an <span
data-type="term">embryo</span> during weeks 3–8, and a <span
data-type="term">fetus</span> from the ninth week of gestation until
birth. In this section, we’ll cover the pre-embryonic and embryonic
stages of development, which are characterized by cell division,
migration, and differentiation. By the end of the embryonic period, all
of the organ systems are structured in rudimentary form, although the
organs themselves are either nonfunctional or only semi-functional.

# Pre-implantation Embryonic Development
{: data-type="title"}

Following fertilization, the zygote and its associated membranes,
together referred to as the <span data-type="term">conceptus</span>,
continue to be projected toward the uterus by peristalsis and beating
cilia. During its journey to the uterus, the zygote undergoes five or
six rapid mitotic cell divisions. Although each <span
data-type="term">cleavage</span> results in more cells, it does not
increase the total volume of the conceptus
([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_02_01){: .autogenerated-content}). Each daughter
cell produced by cleavage is called a <span
data-type="term">blastomere</span> (blastos = “germ,” in the sense of a
seed or sprout).
{: #fs-id1415291}

Approximately 3 days after fertilization, a 16-cell conceptus reaches
the uterus. The cells that had been loosely grouped are now compacted
and look more like a solid mass. The name given to this structure is the
<span data-type="term">morula</span> (morula = “little mulberry”). Once
inside the uterus, the conceptus floats freely for several more days. It
continues to divide, creating a ball of approximately 100 cells, and
consuming nutritive endometrial secretions called uterine milk while the
uterine lining thickens. The ball of now tightly bound cells starts to
secrete fluid and organize themselves around a fluid-filled cavity, the
<span data-type="term">blastocoel</span>. At this developmental stage,
the conceptus is referred to as a <span
data-type="term">blastocyst</span>. Within this structure, a group of
cells forms into an <span data-type="term">inner cell mass</span>, which
is fated to become the embryo. The cells that form the outer shell are
called <span data-type="term">trophoblasts</span> (trophe = “to feed” or
“to nourish”). These cells will develop into the chorionic sac and the
fetal portion of the <span data-type="term">placenta</span> (the organ
of nutrient, waste, and gas exchange between mother and the developing
offspring).
{: #fs-id2347724}

The inner mass of embryonic cells is totipotent during this stage,
meaning that each cell has the potential to differentiate into any cell
type in the human body. Totipotency lasts for only a few days before the
cells’ fates are set as being the precursors to a specific lineage of
cells.

As the blastocyst forms, the trophoblast excretes enzymes that begin to
degrade the zona pellucida. In a process called “hatching,” the
conceptus breaks free of the zona pellucida in preparation for
implantation.

# Implantation
{: data-type="title"}

At the end of the first week, the blastocyst comes in contact with the
uterine wall and adheres to it, embedding itself in the uterine lining
via the trophoblast cells. Thus begins the process of <span
data-type="term">implantation</span>, which signals the end of the
pre-embryonic stage of development ([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_02_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). Implantation can be accompanied by minor
bleeding. The blastocyst typically implants in the fundus of the uterus
or on the posterior wall. However, if the endometrium is not fully
developed and ready to receive the blastocyst, the blastocyst will
detach and find a better spot. A significant percentage (50–75 percent)
of blastocysts fail to implant; when this occurs, the blastocyst is shed
with the endometrium during menses. The high rate of implantation
failure is one reason why pregnancy typically requires several ovulation
cycles to achieve.

When implantation succeeds and the blastocyst adheres to the
endometrium, the superficial cells of the trophoblast fuse with each
other, forming the <span data-type="term">syncytiotrophoblast</span>, a
multinucleated body that digests endometrial cells to firmly secure the
blastocyst to the uterine wall. In response, the uterine mucosa rebuilds
itself and envelops the blastocyst ([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_02_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). The trophoblast secretes <span
data-type="term">human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)</span>, a hormone
that directs the corpus luteum to survive, enlarge, and continue
producing progesterone and estrogen to suppress menses. These functions
of hCG are necessary for creating an environment suitable for the
developing embryo. As a result of this increased production, hCG
accumulates in the maternal bloodstream and is excreted in the urine.
Implantation is complete by the middle of the second week. Just a few
days after implantation, the trophoblast has secreted enough hCG for an
at-home urine pregnancy test to give a positive result.

Most of the time an embryo implants within the body of the uterus in a
location that can support growth and development. However, in one to two
percent of cases, the embryo implants either outside the uterus (an
<span data-type="term">ectopic pregnancy</span>) or in a region of
uterus that can create complications for the pregnancy. If the embryo
implants in the inferior portion of the uterus, the placenta can
potentially grow over the opening of the cervix, a condition call <span
data-type="term">placenta previa</span>.

Disorders of the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Development of the Embryo</span> In the vast
majority of ectopic pregnancies, the embryo does not complete its
journey to the uterus and implants in the uterine tube, referred to as a
tubal pregnancy. However, there are also ovarian ectopic pregnancies (in
which the egg never left the ovary) and abdominal ectopic pregnancies
(in which an egg was “lost” to the abdominal cavity during the transfer
from ovary to uterine tube, or in which an embryo from a tubal pregnancy
re-implanted in the abdomen). Once in the abdominal cavity, an embryo
can implant into any well-vascularized structure—the rectouterine cavity
(Douglas’ pouch), the mesentery of the intestines, and the greater
omentum are some common sites.
{: #fs-id2797558}

Tubal pregnancies can be caused by scar tissue within the tube following
a sexually transmitted bacterial infection. The scar tissue impedes the
progress of the embryo into the uterus—in some cases “snagging” the
embryo and, in other cases, blocking the tube completely. Approximately
one half of tubal pregnancies resolve spontaneously. Implantation in a
uterine tube causes bleeding, which appears to stimulate smooth muscle
contractions and expulsion of the embryo. In the remaining cases,
medical or surgical intervention is necessary. If an ectopic pregnancy
is detected early, the embryo’s development can be arrested by the
administration of the cytotoxic drug methotrexate, which inhibits the
metabolism of folic acid. If diagnosis is late and the uterine tube is
already ruptured, surgical repair is essential.
{: #fs-id2569765}

Even if the embryo has successfully found its way to the uterus, it does
not always implant in an optimal location (the fundus or the posterior
wall of the uterus). Placenta previa can result if an embryo implants
close to the internal os of the uterus (the internal opening of the
cervix). As the fetus grows, the placenta can partially or completely
cover the opening of the cervix ([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_02_04){:
.autogenerated-content}). Although it occurs in only 0.5 percent of
pregnancies, placenta previa is the leading cause of antepartum
hemorrhage (profuse vaginal bleeding after week 24 of pregnancy but
prior to childbirth).

# Embryonic Membranes
{: data-type="title"}

During the second week of development, with the embryo implanted in the
uterus, cells within the blastocyst start to organize into layers. Some
grow to form the extra-embryonic membranes needed to support and protect
the growing embryo: the amnion, the yolk sac, the allantois, and the
chorion.
{: #fs-id1521962}

At the beginning of the second week, the cells of the inner cell mass
form into a two-layered disc of embryonic cells, and a space—the <span
data-type="term">amniotic cavity</span>—opens up between it and the
trophoblast ([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_02_05){: .autogenerated-content}).
Cells from the upper layer of the disc (the <span
data-type="term">epiblast</span>) extend around the amniotic cavity,
creating a membranous sac that forms into the <span
data-type="term">amnion</span> by the end of the second week. The amnion
fills with amniotic fluid and eventually grows to surround the embryo.
Early in development, amniotic fluid consists almost entirely of a
filtrate of maternal plasma, but as the kidneys of the fetus begin to
function at approximately the eighth week, they add urine to the volume
of amniotic fluid. Floating within the amniotic fluid, the embryo—and
later, the fetus—is protected from trauma and rapid temperature changes.
It can move freely within the fluid and can prepare for swallowing and
breathing out of the uterus.

</figure>
On the ventral side of the embryonic disc, opposite the amnion, cells in
the lower layer of the embryonic disk (the <span
data-type="term">hypoblast</span>) extend into the blastocyst cavity and
form a <span data-type="term">yolk sac</span>. The yolk sac supplies
some nutrients absorbed from the trophoblast and also provides primitive
blood circulation to the developing embryo for the second and third week
of development. When the placenta takes over nourishing the embryo at
approximately week 4, the yolk sac has been greatly reduced in size and
its main function is to serve as the source of blood cells and germ
cells (cells that will give rise to gametes). During week 3, a
finger-like outpocketing of the yolk sac develops into the <span
data-type="term">allantois</span>, a primitive excretory duct of the
embryo that will become part of the urinary bladder. Together, the
stalks of the yolk sac and allantois establish the outer structure of
the umbilical cord.

surrounds all others. The development of the chorion will be discussed

# Embryogenesis

As the third week of development begins, the two-layered disc of cells
becomes a three-layered disc through the process of <span
data-type="term">gastrulation</span>, during which the cells transition
from totipotency to multipotency. The embryo, which takes the shape of
an oval-shaped disc, forms an indentation called the <span
data-type="term">primitive streak</span> along the dorsal surface of the
epiblast. A node at the caudal or “tail” end of the primitive streak
emits growth factors that direct cells to multiply and migrate. Cells
migrate toward and through the primitive streak and then move laterally
to create two new layers of cells. The first layer is the <span
data-type="term">endoderm</span>, a sheet of cells that displaces the
hypoblast and lies adjacent to the yolk sac. The second layer of cells
fills in as the middle layer, or <span data-type="term">mesoderm</span>.
The cells of the epiblast that remain (not having migrated through the
primitive streak) become the <span data-type="term">ectoderm</span>

Each of these germ layers will develop into specific structures in the
embryo. Whereas the ectoderm and endoderm form tightly connected
epithelial sheets, the mesodermal cells are less organized and exist as
a loosely connected cell community. The ectoderm gives rise to cell
lineages that differentiate to become the central and peripheral nervous
systems, sensory organs, epidermis, hair, and nails. Mesodermal cells
ultimately become the skeleton, muscles, connective tissue, heart, blood
vessels, and kidneys. The endoderm goes on to form the epithelial lining
of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas, as well as the lungs

# Development of the Placenta
{: data-type="title"}

During the first several weeks of development, the cells of the
endometrium—referred to as decidual cells—nourish the nascent embryo.
During prenatal weeks 4–12, the developing placenta gradually takes over
the role of feeding the embryo, and the decidual cells are no longer
needed. The mature placenta is composed of tissues derived from the
embryo, as well as maternal tissues of the endometrium. The placenta
connects to the conceptus via the <span data-type="term">umbilical
cord</span>, which carries deoxygenated blood and wastes from the fetus
through two umbilical arteries; nutrients and oxygen are carried from
the mother to the fetus through the single umbilical vein. The umbilical
cord is surrounded by the amnion, and the spaces within the cord around
the blood vessels are filled with Wharton’s jelly, a mucous connective
tissue.
{: #fs-id2347718}

The maternal portion of the placenta develops from the deepest layer of
the endometrium, the decidua basalis. To form the embryonic portion of
the placenta, the syncytiotrophoblast and the underlying cells of the
trophoblast (cytotrophoblast cells) begin to proliferate along with a
layer of extraembryonic mesoderm cells. These form the <span
data-type="term">chorionic membrane</span>, which envelops the entire
conceptus as the chorion. The chorionic membrane forms finger-like
structures called <span data-type="term">chorionic villi</span> that
burrow into the endometrium like tree roots, making up the fetal portion
of the placenta. The cytotrophoblast cells perforate the chorionic
villi, burrow farther into the endometrium, and remodel maternal blood
vessels to augment maternal blood flow surrounding the villi. Meanwhile,
fetal mesenchymal cells derived from the mesoderm fill the villi and
differentiate into blood vessels, including the three umbilical blood
vessels that connect the embryo to the developing placenta
([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_02_08){: .autogenerated-content}).

</figure>
The placenta develops throughout the embryonic period and during the
first several weeks of the fetal period; <span
data-type="term">placentation</span> is complete by weeks 14–16. As a
fully developed organ, the placenta provides nutrition and excretion,
respiration, and endocrine function ([\[link\]](#tbl-ch29_01){:
.autogenerated-content} and [\[link\]](#fig-ch29_02_09){:
.autogenerated-content}). It receives blood from the fetus through the
umbilical arteries. Capillaries in the chorionic villi filter fetal
wastes out of the blood and return clean, oxygenated blood to the fetus
through the umbilical vein. Nutrients and oxygen are transferred from
maternal blood surrounding the villi through the capillaries and into
the fetal bloodstream. Some substances move across the placenta by
simple diffusion. Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and any other lipid-soluble
substances take this route. Other substances move across by facilitated
diffusion. This includes water-soluble glucose. The fetus has a high
demand for amino acids and iron, and those substances are moved across
the placenta by active transport.
{: #fs-id2268687}

Maternal and fetal blood does not commingle because blood cells cannot
move across the placenta. This separation prevents the mother’s
cytotoxic T cells from reaching and subsequently destroying the fetus,
which bears “non-self” antigens. Further, it ensures the fetal red blood
cells do not enter the mother’s circulation and trigger antibody
development (if they carry “non-self” antigens)—at least until the final
stages of pregnancy or birth. This is the reason that, even in the
absence of preventive treatment, an Rh<sup>−</sup> mother doesn’t
develop antibodies that could cause hemolytic disease in her first
Rh<sup>+</sup> fetus.
{: #fs-id2427601}

Although blood cells are not exchanged, the chorionic villi provide
ample surface area for the two-way exchange of substances between
maternal and fetal blood. The rate of exchange increases throughout
gestation as the villi become thinner and increasingly branched. The
placenta is permeable to lipid-soluble fetotoxic substances: alcohol,
nicotine, barbiturates, antibiotics, certain pathogens, and many other
substances that can be dangerous or fatal to the developing embryo or
fetus. For these reasons, pregnant women should avoid fetotoxic
substances. Alcohol consumption by pregnant women, for example, can
result in a range of abnormalities referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum
disorders (FASD). These include organ and facial malformations, as well
as cognitive and behavioral disorders.

Following gastrulation, rudiments of the central nervous system develop
from the ectoderm in the process of <span
data-type="term">neurulation</span> ([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_02_10){:

length of the embryo thicken into the <span data-type="term">neural
plate</span>. During the fourth week, tissues on either side of the
plate fold upward into a <span data-type="term">neural fold</span>. The
two folds converge to form the <span data-type="term">neural
tube</span>. The tube lies atop a rod-shaped, mesoderm-derived <span
data-type="term">notochord</span>, which eventually becomes the nucleus
pulposus of intervertebral discs. Block-like structures called <span
data-type="term">somites</span> form on either side of the tube,
eventually differentiating into the axial skeleton, skeletal muscle, and
dermis. During the fourth and fifth weeks, the anterior neural tube
dilates and subdivides to form vesicles that will become the brain
structures.
{: #fs-id1632656}

Folate, one of the B vitamins, is important to the healthy development
of the neural tube. A deficiency of maternal folate in the first weeks
of pregnancy can result in neural tube defects, including spina bifida—a
birth defect in which spinal tissue protrudes through the newborn’s
vertebral column, which has failed to completely close. A more severe
neural tube defect is anencephaly, a partial or complete absence of
brain tissue.

The embryo, which begins as a flat sheet of cells, begins to acquire a
cylindrical shape through the process of <span
data-type="term">embryonic folding</span> ([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_02_11){:
.autogenerated-content}). The embryo folds laterally and again at either
end, forming a C-shape with distinct head and tail ends. The embryo
envelops a portion of the yolk sac, which protrudes with the umbilical
cord from what will become the abdomen. The folding essentially creates
a tube, called the primitive gut, that is lined by the endoderm. The
amniotic sac, which was sitting on top of the flat embryo, envelops the
embryo as it folds.

Within the first 8 weeks of gestation, a developing embryo establishes
the rudimentary structures of all of its organs and tissues from the
ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. This process is called <span
data-type="term">organogenesis</span>.

Like the central nervous system, the heart also begins its development
in the embryo as a tube-like structure, connected via capillaries to the
chorionic villi. Cells of the primitive tube-shaped heart are capable of
electrical conduction and contraction. The heart begins beating in the
beginning of the fourth week, although it does not actually pump
embryonic blood until a week later, when the oversized liver has begun
producing red blood cells. (This is a temporary responsibility of the
embryonic liver that the bone marrow will assume during fetal
development.) During weeks 4–5, the eye pits form, limb buds become
apparent, and the rudiments of the pulmonary system are formed.
{: #fs-id2717095}

During the sixth week, uncontrolled fetal limb movements begin to occur.
The gastrointestinal system develops too rapidly for the embryonic
abdomen to accommodate it, and the intestines temporarily loop into the
umbilical cord. Paddle-shaped hands and feet develop fingers and toes by
the process of apoptosis (programmed cell death), which causes the
tissues between the fingers to disintegrate. By week 7, the facial
structure is more complex and includes nostrils, outer ears, and lenses
([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_02_12){: .autogenerated-content}). By the eighth
week, the head is nearly as large as the rest of the embryo’s body, and
all major brain structures are in place. The external genitalia are
apparent, but at this point, male and female embryos are
indistinguishable. Bone begins to replace cartilage in the embryonic
skeleton through the process of ossification. By the end of the
embryonic period, the embryo is approximately 3 cm (1.2 in) from crown
to rump and weighs approximately 8 g (0.25 oz).

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

As the zygote travels toward the uterus, it undergoes numerous cleavages
in which the number of cells doubles (blastomeres). Upon reaching the
uterus, the conceptus has become a tightly packed sphere of cells called
the morula, which then forms into a blastocyst consisting of an inner
cell mass within a fluid-filled cavity surrounded by trophoblasts. The
blastocyst implants in the uterine wall, the trophoblasts fuse to form a
syncytiotrophoblast, and the conceptus is enveloped by the endometrium.
Four embryonic membranes form to support the growing embryo: the amnion,
the yolk sac, the allantois, and the chorion. The chorionic villi of the
chorion extend into the endometrium to form the fetal portion of the
placenta. The placenta supplies the growing embryo with oxygen and
nutrients; it also removes carbon dioxide and other metabolic wastes.
{: #fs-id1378418}

Following implantation, embryonic cells undergo gastrulation, in which
they differentiate and separate into an embryonic disc and establish
three primary germ layers (the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm).
Through the process of embryonic folding, the fetus begins to take
shape. Neurulation starts the process of the development of structures
of the central nervous system and organogenesis establishes the basic
plan for all organ systems.

Folate, one of the B vitamins, is important for the healthy formation of
the embryonic neural tube, which occurs in the first few weeks following
conception—often before a woman even realizes she is pregnant. A
folate-deficient environment increases the risk of a neural tube defect,
such as spina bidifa, in the newborn.
