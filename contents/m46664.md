Recall that cardiac muscle shares a few characteristics with both
skeletal muscle and smooth muscle, but it has some unique properties of
its own. Not the least of these exceptional properties is its ability to
initiate an electrical potential at a fixed rate that spreads rapidly
from cell to cell to trigger the contractile mechanism. This property is
known as <span data-type="term">autorhythmicity</span>. Neither smooth
nor skeletal muscle can do this. Even though cardiac muscle has
autorhythmicity, heart rate is modulated by the endocrine and nervous
systems.

There are two major types of cardiac muscle cells: myocardial
contractile cells and myocardial conducting cells. The <span
data-type="term">myocardial contractile cells</span> constitute the bulk
(99 percent) of the cells in the atria and ventricles. Contractile cells
conduct impulses and are responsible for contractions that pump blood
through the body. The <span data-type="term">myocardial conducting
cells</span> (1 percent of the cells) form the conduction system of the
heart. Except for Purkinje cells, they are generally much smaller than
the contractile cells and have few of the myofibrils or filaments needed
for contraction. Their function is similar in many respects to neurons,
although they are specialized muscle cells. Myocardial conduction cells
initiate and propagate the action potential (the electrical impulse)
that travels throughout the heart and triggers the contractions that
propel the blood.

# Structure of Cardiac Muscle
{: data-type="title"}

Compared to the giant cylinders of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle
cells, or cardiomyocytes, are considerably shorter with much smaller
diameters. Cardiac muscle also demonstrates striations, the alternating
pattern of dark A bands and light I bands attributed to the precise
arrangement of the myofilaments and fibrils that are organized in
sarcomeres along the length of the cell ([\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_01){:
.autogenerated-content}**a**{: data-effect="bold"}). These contractile
elements are virtually identical to skeletal muscle. T (transverse)
tubules penetrate from the surface plasma membrane, the sarcolemma, to
the interior of the cell, allowing the electrical impulse to reach the
interior. The T tubules are only found at the Z discs, whereas in
skeletal muscle, they are found at the junction of the A and I bands.
Therefore, there are one-half as many T tubules in cardiac muscle as in
skeletal muscle. In addition, the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores few
calcium ions, so most of the calcium ions must come from outside the
cells. The result is a slower onset of contraction. Mitochondria are
plentiful, providing energy for the contractions of the heart.
Typically, cardiomyocytes have a single, central nucleus, but two or
more nuclei may be found in some cells.
{: #fs-id2868561}

Cardiac muscle cells branch freely. A junction between two adjoining
cells is marked by a critical structure called an <span
data-type="term">intercalated disc</span>, which helps support the
synchronized contraction of the muscle ([\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_01){:
.autogenerated-content}**b**{: data-effect="bold"}). The sarcolemmas
from adjacent cells bind together at the intercalated discs. They
consist of desmosomes, specialized linking proteoglycans, tight
junctions, and large numbers of gap junctions that allow the passage of
ions between the cells and help to synchronize the contraction
([\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_01){: .autogenerated-content}**c**{:
data-effect="bold"}). Intercellular connective tissue also helps to bind
the cells together. The importance of strongly binding these cells
together is necessitated by the forces exerted by contraction.

Cardiac muscle undergoes aerobic respiration patterns, primarily
metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates. Myoglobin, lipids, and glycogen
are all stored within the cytoplasm. Cardiac muscle cells undergo
twitch-type contractions with long refractory periods followed by brief
relaxation periods. The relaxation is essential so the heart can fill
with blood for the next cycle. The refractory period is very long to
prevent the possibility of tetany, a condition in which muscle remains
involuntarily contracted. In the heart, tetany is not compatible with
life, since it would prevent the heart from pumping blood.

Everyday Connection

<span data-type="title">Repair and Replacement</span> Damaged cardiac
muscle cells have extremely limited abilities to repair themselves or to
replace dead cells via mitosis. Recent evidence indicates that at least
some stem cells remain within the heart that continue to divide and at
least potentially replace these dead cells. However, newly formed or
repaired cells are rarely as functional as the original cells, and
cardiac function is reduced. In the event of a heart attack or MI, dead
cells are often replaced by patches of scar tissue. Autopsies performed
on individuals who had successfully received heart transplants show some
proliferation of original cells. If researchers can unlock the mechanism
that generates new cells and restore full mitotic capabilities to heart
muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly
enhanced. To date, myocardial cells produced within the patient (*in
situ*{: data-effect="italics"}) by cardiac stem cells seem to be
nonfunctional, although those grown in Petri dishes (*in vitro*{:
data-effect="italics"}) do beat. Perhaps soon this mystery will be
solved, and new advances in treatment will be commonplace.

# Conduction System of the Heart
{: data-type="title"}

If embryonic heart cells are separated into a Petri dish and kept alive,
each is capable of generating its own electrical impulse followed by
contraction. When two independently beating embryonic cardiac muscle
cells are placed together, the cell with the higher inherent rate sets
the pace, and the impulse spreads from the faster to the slower cell to
trigger a contraction. As more cells are joined together, the fastest
cell continues to assume control of the rate. A fully developed adult
heart maintains the capability of generating its own electrical impulse,
triggered by the fastest cells, as part of the cardiac conduction
system. The components of the cardiac conduction system include the
sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, the atrioventricular bundle,
the atrioventricular bundle branches, and the Purkinje cells
([\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_02){: .autogenerated-content}).

## Sinoatrial (SA) Node
{: data-type="title"}

Normal cardiac rhythm is established by the <span
data-type="term">sinoatrial (SA) node</span>, a specialized clump of
myocardial conducting cells located in the superior and posterior walls
of the right atrium in close proximity to the orifice of the superior
vena cava. The SA node has the highest inherent rate of depolarization
and is known as the <span data-type="term">pacemaker</span> of the
heart. It initiates the <span data-type="term">sinus rhythm</span>, or
normal electrical pattern followed by contraction of the heart.
{: #fs-id3089583}

This impulse spreads from its initiation in the SA node throughout the
atria through specialized <span data-type="term">internodal
pathways</span>, to the atrial myocardial contractile cells and the
atrioventricular node. The internodal pathways consist of three bands
(anterior, middle, and posterior) that lead directly from the SA node to
the next node in the conduction system, the atrioventricular node (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_02){: .autogenerated-content}). The impulse
takes approximately 50 ms (milliseconds) to travel between these two
nodes. The relative importance of this pathway has been debated since
the impulse would reach the atrioventricular node simply following the
cell-by-cell pathway through the contractile cells of the myocardium in
the atria. In addition, there is a specialized pathway called <span
data-type="term">Bachmann’s bundle</span> or the <span
data-type="term">interatrial band</span> that conducts the impulse
directly from the right atrium to the left atrium. Regardless of the
pathway, as the impulse reaches the atrioventricular septum, the
connective tissue of the cardiac skeleton prevents the impulse from
spreading into the myocardial cells in the ventricles except at the
atrioventricular node. [\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_03){:
.autogenerated-content} illustrates the initiation of the impulse in the
SA node that then spreads the impulse throughout the atria to the
atrioventricular node.

fibers, and also reaches the right papillary muscle via the moderator

The electrical event, the wave of depolarization, is the trigger for
muscular contraction. The wave of depolarization begins in the right
atrium, and the impulse spreads across the superior portions of both
atria and then down through the contractile cells. The contractile cells
then begin contraction from the superior to the inferior portions of the
atria, efficiently pumping blood into the ventricles.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2213522" markdown="1">
## Atrioventricular (AV) Node
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">atrioventricular (AV) node</span> is a second
clump of specialized myocardial conductive cells, located in the
inferior portion of the right atrium within the atrioventricular septum.
The septum prevents the impulse from spreading directly to the
ventricles without passing through the AV node. There is a critical
pause before the AV node depolarizes and transmits the impulse to the
atrioventricular bundle (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_03){:
.autogenerated-content}, step 3). This delay in transmission is
partially attributable to the small diameter of the cells of the node,
which slow the impulse. Also, conduction between nodal cells is less
efficient than between conducting cells. These factors mean that it
takes the impulse approximately 100 ms to pass through the node. This
pause is critical to heart function, as it allows the atrial
cardiomyocytes to complete their contraction that pumps blood into the
ventricles before the impulse is transmitted to the cells of the
ventricle itself. With extreme stimulation by the SA node, the AV node
can transmit impulses maximally at 220 per minute. This establishes the
typical maximum heart rate in a healthy young individual. Damaged hearts
or those stimulated by drugs can contract at higher rates, but at these
rates, the heart can no longer effectively pump blood.

## Atrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers
{: data-type="title"}

Arising from the AV node, the <span data-type="term">atrioventricular
bundle</span>, or <span data-type="term">bundle of His</span>, proceeds
through the interventricular septum before dividing into two <span
data-type="term">atrioventricular bundle branches</span>, commonly
called the left and right bundle branches. The left bundle branch has
two fascicles. The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and
the right bundle branch the right ventricle. Since the left ventricle is
much larger than the right, the left bundle branch is also considerably
larger than the right. Portions of the right bundle branch are found in
the moderator band and supply the right papillary muscles. Because of
this connection, each papillary muscle receives the impulse at
approximately the same time, so they begin to contract simultaneously
just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile cells of the
ventricles. This is believed to allow tension to develop on the chordae
tendineae prior to right ventricular contraction. There is no
corresponding moderator band on the left. Both bundle branches descend
and reach the apex of the heart where they connect with the Purkinje
fibers (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}, step
4). This passage takes approximately 25 ms.
{: #fs-id1273399}

The <span data-type="term">Purkinje fibers</span> are additional
myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial
contractile cells in the ventricles. They extend throughout the
myocardium from the apex of the heart toward the atrioventricular septum
and the base of the heart. The Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent
conduction rate, and the electrical impulse reaches all of the
ventricular muscle cells in about 75 ms (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}, step 5). Since
the electrical stimulus begins at the apex, the contraction also begins
at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart, similar to
squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom. This allows the blood to
be pumped out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary trunk.
The total time elapsed from the initiation of the impulse in the SA node
until depolarization of the ventricles is approximately 225 ms.

## Membrane Potentials and Ion Movement in Cardiac Conductive Cells
{: data-type="title"}

Action potentials are considerably different between cardiac conductive
cells and cardiac contractive cells. While Na<sup>+</sup> and
K<sup>+</sup> play essential roles, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also critical for
both types of cells. Unlike skeletal muscles and neurons, cardiac
conductive cells do not have a stable resting potential. Conductive
cells contain a series of sodium ion channels that allow a normal and
slow influx of sodium ions that causes the membrane potential to rise
slowly from an initial value of −60 mV up to about –40 mV. The resulting
movement of sodium ions creates <span data-type="term">spontaneous
depolarization</span> (or <span data-type="term">prepotential
depolarization</span>). At this point, calcium ion channels open and
Ca<sup>2+ </sup>enters the cell, further depolarizing it at a more rapid
rate until it reaches a value of approximately +5 mV. At this point, the
calcium ion channels close and K<sup>+</sup> channels open, allowing
outflux of K<sup>+</sup> and resulting in repolarization. When the
membrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the K<sup>+
</sup>channels close and Na<sup>+</sup> channels open, and the
prepotential phase begins again. This phenomenon explains the
autorhythmicity properties of cardiac muscle
([\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_04){: .autogenerated-content}).

The prepotential is due to a slow influx of sodium ions until the

## Membrane Potentials and Ion Movement in Cardiac Contractile Cells
{: data-type="title"}

There is a distinctly different electrical pattern involving the
contractile cells. In this case, there is a rapid depolarization,
followed by a plateau phase and then repolarization. This phenomenon
accounts for the long refractory periods required for the cardiac muscle
cells to pump blood effectively before they are capable of firing for a
second time. These cardiac myocytes normally do not initiate their own
electrical potential, although they are capable of doing so, but rather
wait for an impulse to reach them.
{: #fs-id2107904}

Contractile cells demonstrate a much more stable resting phase than
conductive cells at approximately −80 mV for cells in the atria and −90
mV for cells in the ventricles. Despite this initial difference, the
other components of their action potentials are virtually identical. In
both cases, when stimulated by an action potential, voltage-gated
channels rapidly open, beginning the positive-feedback mechanism of
depolarization. This rapid influx of positively charged ions raises the
membrane potential to approximately +30 mV, at which point the sodium
channels close. The rapid depolarization period typically lasts 3–5 ms.
Depolarization is followed by the plateau phase, in which membrane
potential declines relatively slowly. This is due in large part to the
opening of the slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, allowing Ca<sup>2+</sup>
to enter the cell while few K<sup>+</sup> channels are open, allowing
K<sup>+</sup> to exit the cell. The relatively long plateau phase lasts
approximately 175 ms. Once the membrane potential reaches approximately
zero, the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels close and K<sup>+ </sup>channels
open, allowing K<sup>+ </sup>to exit the cell. The repolarization lasts
approximately 75 ms. At this point, membrane potential drops until it
reaches resting levels once more and the cycle repeats. The entire event
lasts between 250 and 300 ms ([\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_05){:
.autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id2965052}

The absolute refractory period for cardiac contractile muscle lasts
approximately 200 ms, and the relative refractory period lasts
approximately 50 ms, for a total of 250 ms. This extended period is
critical, since the heart muscle must contract to pump blood effectively
and the contraction must follow the electrical events. Without extended
refractory periods, premature contractions would occur in the heart and
would not be compatible with life.

## Calcium Ions
{: data-type="title"}

Calcium ions play two critical roles in the physiology of cardiac
muscle. Their influx through slow calcium channels accounts for the
prolonged plateau phase and absolute refractory period that enable
cardiac muscle to function properly. Calcium ions also combine with the
regulatory protein troponin in the troponin-tropomyosin complex; this
complex removes the inhibition that prevents the heads of the myosin
molecules from forming cross bridges with the active sites on actin that
provide the power stroke of contraction. This mechanism is virtually
identical to that of skeletal muscle. Approximately 20 percent of the
calcium required for contraction is supplied by the influx of
Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the plateau phase. The remaining Ca<sup>2+</sup>
for contraction is released from storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

## Comparative Rates of Conduction System Firing
{: data-type="title"}

The pattern of prepotential or spontaneous depolarization, followed by
rapid depolarization and repolarization just described, are seen in the
SA node and a few other conductive cells in the heart. Since the SA node
is the pacemaker, it reaches threshold faster than any other component
of the conduction system. It will initiate the impulses spreading to the
other conducting cells. The SA node, without nervous or endocrine
control, would initiate a heart impulse approximately 80–100 times per
minute. Although each component of the conduction system is capable of
generating its own impulse, the rate progressively slows as you proceed
from the SA node to the Purkinje fibers. Without the SA node, the AV
node would generate a heart rate of 40–60 beats per minute. If the AV
node were blocked, the atrioventricular bundle would fire at a rate of
approximately 30–40 impulses per minute. The bundle branches would have
an inherent rate of 20–30 impulses per minute, and the Purkinje fibers
would fire at 15–20 impulses per minute. While a few exceptionally
trained aerobic athletes demonstrate resting heart rates in the range of
30–40 beats per minute (the lowest recorded figure is 28 beats per
minute for Miguel Indurain, a cyclist), for most individuals, rates
lower than 50 beats per minute would indicate a condition called
bradycardia. Depending upon the specific individual, as rates fall much
below this level, the heart would be unable to maintain adequate flow of
blood to vital tissues, initially resulting in decreasing loss of
function across the systems, unconsciousness, and ultimately death.

# Electrocardiogram
{: data-type="title"}

By careful placement of surface electrodes on the body, it is possible
to record the complex, compound electrical signal of the heart. This
tracing of the electrical signal is the <span
data-type="term">electrocardiogram (ECG)</span>, also commonly
abbreviated EKG (K coming kardiology, from the German term for
cardiology). Careful analysis of the ECG reveals a detailed picture of
both normal and abnormal heart function, and is an indispensable
clinical diagnostic tool. The standard electrocardiograph (the
instrument that generates an ECG) uses 3, 5, or 12 leads. The greater
the number of leads an electrocardiograph uses, the more information the
ECG provides. The term “lead” may be used to refer to the cable from the
electrode to the electrical recorder, but it typically describes the
voltage difference between two of the electrodes. The 12-lead
electrocardiograph uses 10 electrodes placed in standard locations on
the patient’s skin ([\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_06){:
.autogenerated-content}). In continuous ambulatory electrocardiographs,
the patient wears a small, portable, battery-operated device known as a
Holter monitor, or simply a Holter, that continuously monitors heart
electrical activity, typically for a period of 24 hours during the
patient’s normal routine.

{: #fs-id1336216}

There are five prominent points on the ECG: the P wave, the QRS complex,
and the T wave. The small <span data-type="term">P wave</span>
represents the depolarization of the atria. The atria begin contracting
approximately 25 ms after the start of the P wave. The large <span
data-type="term">QRS complex</span> represents the depolarization of the
ventricles, which requires a much stronger electrical signal because of
the larger size of the ventricular cardiac muscle. The ventricles begin
to contract as the QRS reaches the peak of the R wave. Lastly, the <span
data-type="term">T wave</span> represents the repolarization of the
ventricles. The repolarization of the atria occurs during the QRS
complex, which masks it on an ECG.
{: #fs-id2458514}

The major segments and intervals of an ECG tracing are indicated in
[\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_07){: .autogenerated-content}. Segments are
defined as the regions between two waves. Intervals include one segment
plus one or more waves. For example, the PR segment begins at the end of
the P wave and ends at the beginning of the QRS complex. The PR interval
starts at the beginning of the P wave and ends with the beginning of the
QRS complex. The PR interval is more clinically relevant, as it measures
the duration from the beginning of atrial depolarization (the P wave) to
the initiation of the QRS complex. Since the Q wave may be difficult to
view in some tracings, the measurement is often extended to the R that
is more easily visible. Should there be a delay in passage of the
impulse from the SA node to the AV node, it would be visible in the PR
interval. [\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_08){: .autogenerated-content}

<span data-type="title">ECG Abnormalities</span> Occassionally, an area
of the heart other than the SA node will initiate an impulse that will
be followed by a premature contraction. Such an area, which may actually
be a component of the conduction system or some other contractile cells,
is known as an ectopic focus or ectopic pacemaker. An ectopic focus may
be stimulated by localized ischemia; exposure to certain drugs,
including caffeine, digitalis, or acetylcholine; elevated stimulation by
both sympathetic or parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous
system; or a number of disease or pathological conditions. Occasional
occurances are generally transitory and nonlife threatening, but if the
condition becomes chronic, it may lead to either an arrhythmia, a
deviation from the normal pattern of impulse conduction and contraction,
or to fibrillation, an uncoordinated beating of the heart.
{: #fs-id2111116}

While interpretation of an ECG is possible and extremely valuable after
some training, a full understanding of the complexities and intricacies
generally requires several years of experience. In general, the size of
the electrical variations, the duration of the events, and detailed
vector analysis provide the most comprehensive picture of cardiac
function. For example, an amplified P wave may indicate enlargement of
the atria, an enlarged Q wave may indicate a MI, and an enlarged
suppressed or inverted Q wave often indicates enlarged ventricles. T
waves often appear flatter when insufficient oxygen is being delivered
to the myocardium. An elevation of the ST segment above baseline is
often seen in patients with an acute MI, and may appear depressed below
the baseline when hypoxia is occurring.
{: #fs-id1293915}

As useful as analyzing these electrical recordings may be, there are
limitations. For example, not all areas suffering a MI may be obvious on
the ECG. Additionally, it will not reveal the effectiveness of the
pumping, which requires further testing, such as an ultrasound test
called an echocardiogram or nuclear medicine imaging. It is also
possible for there to be pulseless electrical activity, which will show
up on an ECG tracing, although there is no corresponding pumping action.
Common abnormalities that may be detected by the ECGs are shown in

<span data-type="title">External Automated Defibrillators</span> In the
event that the electrical activity of the heart is severely disrupted,
cessation of electrical activity or fibrillation may occur. In
fibrillation, the heart beats in a wild, uncontrolled manner, which
prevents it from being able to pump effectively. Atrial fibrillation
(see [\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_09){: .autogenerated-content}**b**{:
data-effect="bold"}) is a serious condition, but as long as the
ventricles continue to pump blood, the patient’s life may not be in
immediate danger. Ventricular fibrillation (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_09){: .autogenerated-content}**d**{:
data-effect="bold"}) is a medical emergency that requires life support,
because the ventricles are not effectively pumping blood. In a hospital
setting, it is often described as “code blue.” If untreated for as
little as a few minutes, ventricular fibrillation may lead to brain
death. The most common treatment is defibrillation, which uses special
paddles to apply a charge to the heart from an external electrical
source in an attempt to establish a normal sinus rhythm
([\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_10){: .autogenerated-content}). A defibrillator
effectively stops the heart so that the SA node can trigger a normal
conduction cycle. Because of their effectiveness in reestablishing a
normal sinus rhythm, external automated defibrillators (EADs) are being
placed in areas frequented by large numbers of people, such as schools,
restaurants, and airports. These devices contain simple and direct
verbal instructions that can be followed by nonmedical personnel in an
attempt to save a life.

A <span data-type="term">heart block</span> refers to an interruption in
the normal conduction pathway. The nomenclature for these is very
straightforward. SA nodal blocks occur within the SA node. AV nodal
blocks occur within the AV node. Infra-Hisian blocks involve the bundle
of His. Bundle branch blocks occur within either the left or right
atrioventricular bundle branches. Hemiblocks are partial and occur
within one or more fascicles of the atrioventricular bundle branch.
Clinically, the most common types are the AV nodal and infra-Hisian
blocks.
{: #fs-id2059534}

AV blocks are often described by degrees. A first-degree or partial
block indicates a delay in conduction between the SA and AV nodes. This
can be recognized on the ECG as an abnormally long PR interval. A
second-degree or incomplete block occurs when some impulses from the SA
node reach the AV node and continue, while others do not. In this
instance, the ECG would reveal some P waves not followed by a QRS
complex, while others would appear normal. In the third-degree or
complete block, there is no correlation between atrial activity (the P
wave) and ventricular activity (the QRS complex). Even in the event of a
total SA block, the AV node will assume the role of pacemaker and
continue initiating contractions at 40–60 contractions per minute, which
is adequate to maintain consciousness. Second- and third-degree blocks
are demonstrated on the ECG presented in [\[link\]](#fig-ch20_02_09){:
.autogenerated-content}.
{: #fs-id1856568}

When arrhythmias become a chronic problem, the heart maintains a
junctional rhythm, which originates in the AV node. In order to speed up
the heart rate and restore full sinus rhythm, a cardiologist can implant
an <span data-type="term">artificial pacemaker</span>, which delivers
electrical impulses to the heart muscle to ensure that the heart
continues to contract and pump blood effectively. These artificial
pacemakers are programmable by the cardiologists and can either provide
stimulation temporarily upon demand or on a continuous basis. Some
devices also contain built-in defibrillators.

# Cardiac Muscle Metabolism
{: data-type="title"}

Normally, cardiac muscle metabolism is entirely aerobic. Oxygen from the
lungs is brought to the heart, and every other organ, attached to the
hemoglobin molecules within the erythrocytes. Heart cells also store
appreciable amounts of oxygen in myoglobin. Normally, these two
mechanisms, circulating oxygen and oxygen attached to myoglobin, can
supply sufficient oxygen to the heart, even during peak performance.
{: #fs-id1010339}

Fatty acids and glucose from the circulation are broken down within the
mitochondria to release energy in the form of ATP. Both fatty acid
droplets and glycogen are stored within the sarcoplasm and provide
additional nutrient supply. (Seek additional content for more detail
about metabolism.)

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The heart is regulated by both neural and endocrine control, yet it is
capable of initiating its own action potential followed by muscular
contraction. The conductive cells within the heart establish the heart
rate and transmit it through the myocardium. The contractile cells
contract and propel the blood. The normal path of transmission for the
conductive cells is the sinoatrial (SA) node, internodal pathways,
atrioventricular (AV) node, atrioventricular (AV) bundle of His, bundle
branches, and Purkinje fibers. The action potential for the conductive
cells consists of a prepotential phase with a slow influx of Na<sup>+
</sup>followed by a rapid influx of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and outflux of
K<sup>+</sup>. Contractile cells have an action potential with an
extended plateau phase that results in an extended refractory period to
allow complete contraction for the heart to pump blood effectively.
Recognizable points on the ECG include the P wave that corresponds to
atrial depolarization, the QRS complex that corresponds to ventricular
depolarization, and the T wave that corresponds to ventricular
repolarization.
