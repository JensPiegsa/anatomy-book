Chapter Objectives
</div>
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* Describe the processes involved in anabolic and catabolic reactions
* List and describe the steps necessary for carbohydrate, lipid, and
  protein metabolism
* Explain the processes that regulate glucose levels during the
  absorptive and postabsorptive states
* Explain how metabolism is essential to maintaining body temperature
  (thermoregulation)
* Summarize the importance of vitamins and minerals in the diet

Eating is essential to life. Many of us look to eating as not only a
necessity, but also a pleasure. You may have been told since childhood
to start the day with a good breakfast to give you the energy to get
through most of the day. You most likely have heard about the importance
of a balanced diet, with plenty of fruits and vegetables. But what does
this all mean to your body and the physiological processes it carries
out each day? You need to absorb a range of nutrients so that your cells
have the building blocks for metabolic processes that release the energy
for the cells to carry out their daily jobs, to manufacture new
proteins, cells, and body parts, and to recycle materials in the cell.

This chapter will take you through some of the chemical reactions
essential to life, the sum of which is referred to as metabolism. The
focus of these discussions will be anabolic reactions and catabolic
reactions. You will examine the various chemical reactions that are
important to sustain life, including why you must have oxygen, how
mitochondria transfer energy, and the importance of certain “metabolic”
hormones and vitamins.

Metabolism varies, depending on age, gender, activity level, fuel
consumption, and lean body mass. Your own metabolic rate fluctuates
throughout life. By modifying your diet and exercise regimen, you can
increase both lean body mass and metabolic rate. Factors affecting
metabolism also play important roles in controlling muscle mass. Aging
is known to decrease the metabolic rate by as much as 5 percent per
year. Additionally, because men tend have more lean muscle mass then
women, their basal metabolic rate (metabolic rate at rest) is higher;
therefore, men tend to burn more calories than women do. Lastly, an
individual’s inherent metabolic rate is a function of the proteins and
enzymes derived from their genetic background. Thus, your genes play a
big role in your metabolism. Nonetheless, each person’s body engages in
the same overall metabolic processes.
