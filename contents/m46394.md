Synovial joints are the most common type of joint in the body
([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_04_01){: .autogenerated-content}). A key
structural characteristic for a synovial joint that is not seen at
fibrous or cartilaginous joints is the presence of a joint cavity. This
fluid-filled space is the site at which the articulating surfaces of the
bones contact each other. Also unlike fibrous or cartilaginous joints,
the articulating bone surfaces at a synovial joint are not directly
connected to each other with fibrous connective tissue or cartilage.
This gives the bones of a synovial joint the ability to move smoothly
against each other, allowing for increased joint mobility.

Synovial joints allow for smooth movements between the adjacent bones.
The joint is surrounded by an articular capsule that defines a joint
cavity filled with synovial fluid. The articulating surfaces of the
bones are covered by a thin layer of articular cartilage. Ligaments
support the joint by holding the bones together and resisting excess or
abnormal joint motions.

# Structural Features of Synovial Joints
{: data-type="title"}

Synovial joints are characterized by the presence of a joint cavity. The
walls of this space are formed by the <span data-type="term">articular
capsule</span>, a fibrous connective tissue structure that is attached
to each bone just outside the area of the bone’s articulating surface.
The bones of the joint articulate with each other within the joint
cavity.
{: #fs-id1375995}

Friction between the bones at a synovial joint is prevented by the
presence of the <span data-type="term">articular cartilage</span>, a
thin layer of hyaline cartilage that covers the entire articulating
surface of each bone. However, unlike at a cartilaginous joint, the
articular cartilages of each bone are not continuous with each other.
Instead, the articular cartilage acts like a Teflon<sup>®</sup> coating
over the bone surface, allowing the articulating bones to move smoothly
against each other without damaging the underlying bone tissue. Lining
the inner surface of the articular capsule is a thin <span
data-type="term">synovial membrane</span>. The cells of this membrane
secrete <span data-type="term">synovial fluid</span> (synovia = “a thick
fluid”), a thick, slimy fluid that provides lubrication to further
reduce friction between the bones of the joint. This fluid also provides
nourishment to the articular cartilage, which does not contain blood
vessels. The ability of the bones to move smoothly against each other
within the joint cavity, and the freedom of joint movement this
provides, means that each synovial joint is functionally classified as a
diarthrosis.
{: #fs-id1720297}

Outside of their articulating surfaces, the bones are connected together
by ligaments, which are strong bands of fibrous connective tissue. These
strengthen and support the joint by anchoring the bones together and
preventing their separation. Ligaments allow for normal movements at a
joint, but limit the range of these motions, thus preventing excessive
or abnormal joint movements. Ligaments are classified based on their
relationship to the fibrous articular capsule. An <span
data-type="term">extrinsic ligament</span> is located outside of the
articular capsule, an <span data-type="term">intrinsic ligament</span>
is fused to or incorporated into the wall of the articular capsule, and
an <span data-type="term">intracapsular ligament</span> is located
inside of the articular capsule.
{: #fs-id1373932}

At many synovial joints, additional support is provided by the muscles
and their tendons that act across the joint. A <span
data-type="term">tendon</span> is the dense connective tissue structure
that attaches a muscle to bone. As forces acting on a joint increase,
the body will automatically increase the overall strength of contraction
of the muscles crossing that joint, thus allowing the muscle and its
tendon to serve as a “dynamic ligament” to resist forces and support the
joint. This type of indirect support by muscles is very important at the
shoulder joint, for example, where the ligaments are relatively weak.

# Additional Structures Associated with Synovial Joints
{: data-type="title"}

A few synovial joints of the body have a fibrocartilage structure
located between the articulating bones. This is called an <span
data-type="term">articular disc</span>, which is generally small and
oval-shaped, or a <span data-type="term">meniscus</span>, which is
larger and C-shaped. These structures can serve several functions,
depending on the specific joint. In some places, an articular disc may
act to strongly unite the bones of the joint to each other. Examples of
this include the articular discs found at the sternoclavicular joint or
between the distal ends of the radius and ulna bones. At other synovial
joints, the disc can provide shock absorption and cushioning between the
bones, which is the function of each meniscus within the knee joint.
Finally, an articular disc can serve to smooth the movements between the
articulating bones, as seen at the temporomandibular joint. Some
synovial joints also have a fat pad, which can serve as a cushion
between the bones.
{: #fs-id1061087}

Additional structures located outside of a synovial joint serve to
prevent friction between the bones of the joint and the overlying muscle
tendons or skin. A <span data-type="term">bursa</span> (plural = bursae)
is a thin connective tissue sac filled with lubricating liquid. They are
located in regions where skin, ligaments, muscles, or muscle tendons can
rub against each other, usually near a body joint
([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_04_02){: .autogenerated-content}). Bursae reduce
friction by separating the adjacent structures, preventing them from
rubbing directly against each other. Bursae are classified by their
location. A <span data-type="term">subcutaneous bursa</span> is located
between the skin and an underlying bone. It allows skin to move smoothly
over the bone. Examples include the prepatellar bursa located over the
kneecap and the olecranon bursa at the tip of the elbow. A <span
data-type="term">submuscular bursa</span> is found between a muscle and
an underlying bone, or between adjacent muscles. These prevent rubbing
of the muscle during movements. A large submuscular bursa, the
trochanteric bursa, is found at the lateral hip, between the greater
trochanter of the femur and the overlying gluteus maximus muscle. A
<span data-type="term">subtendinous bursa</span> is found between a
tendon and a bone. Examples include the subacromial bursa that protects
the tendon of shoulder muscle as it passes under the acromion of the
scapula, and the suprapatellar bursa that separates the tendon of the
large anterior thigh muscle from the distal femur just above the knee.

Bursae
</div>
<figcaption>
Bursae are fluid-filled sacs that serve to prevent friction between
skin, muscle, or tendon and an underlying bone. Three major bursae and a
fat pad are part of the complex joint that unites the femur and tibia of
the leg.

</figure>
A <span data-type="term">tendon sheath</span> is similar in structure to
a bursa, but smaller. It is a connective tissue sac that surrounds a
muscle tendon at places where the tendon crosses a joint. It contains a
lubricating fluid that allows for smooth motions of the tendon during
muscle contraction and joint movements.

<span data-type="title">Bursitis</span> Bursitis is the inflammation of
a bursa near a joint. This will cause pain, swelling, or tenderness of
the bursa and surrounding area, and may also result in joint stiffness.
Bursitis is most commonly associated with the bursae found at or near
the shoulder, hip, knee, or elbow joints. At the shoulder, subacromial
bursitis may occur in the bursa that separates the acromion of the
scapula from the tendon of a shoulder muscle as it passes deep to the
acromion. In the hip region, trochanteric bursitis can occur in the
bursa that overlies the greater trochanter of the femur, just below the
lateral side of the hip. Ischial bursitis occurs in the bursa that
separates the skin from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis, the bony
structure that is weight bearing when sitting. At the knee, inflammation
and swelling of the bursa located between the skin and patella bone is
prepatellar bursitis (“housemaid’s knee”), a condition more commonly
seen today in roofers or floor and carpet installers who do not use knee
pads. At the elbow, olecranon bursitis is inflammation of the bursa
between the skin and olecranon process of the ulna. The olecranon forms
the bony tip of the elbow, and bursitis here is also known as “student’s
elbow.”
{: #fs-id2584481}

Bursitis can be either acute (lasting only a few days) or chronic. It
can arise from muscle overuse, trauma, excessive or prolonged pressure
on the skin, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or infection of the joint.
Repeated acute episodes of bursitis can result in a chronic condition.
Treatments for the disorder include antibiotics if the bursitis is
caused by an infection, or anti-inflammatory agents, such as
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids if the
bursitis is due to trauma or overuse. Chronic bursitis may require that
fluid be drained, but additional surgery is usually not required.

# Types of Synovial Joints
{: data-type="title"}

Synovial joints are subdivided based on the shapes of the articulating
surfaces of the bones that form each joint. The six types of synovial
joints are pivot, hinge, condyloid, saddle, plane, and ball-and
socket-joints ([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_04_03){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1289953}

<figure id="fig-ch09_04_03">
<div data-type="title">
Types of Synovial Joints
</div>
<figcaption>
The six types of synovial joints allow the body to move in a variety of
ways. (a) Pivot joints allow for rotation around an axis, such as
between the first and second cervical vertebrae, which allows for
side-to-side rotation of the head. (b) The hinge joint of the elbow
works like a door hinge. (c) The articulation between the trapezium
carpal bone and the first metacarpal bone at the base of the thumb is a
saddle joint. (d) Plane joints, such as those between the tarsal bones
of the foot, allow for limited gliding movements between bones. (e) The
radiocarpal joint of the wrist is a condyloid joint. (f) The hip and
shoulder joints are the only ball-and-socket joints of the body.

names and locations."> ![This composite image shows the different types

</figure>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1926546" markdown="1">
## Pivot Joint
{: data-type="title"}

At a <span data-type="term">pivot joint</span>, a rounded portion of a
bone is enclosed within a ring formed partially by the articulation with
another bone and partially by a ligament (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch09_04_03){: .autogenerated-content}**a**{:
data-effect="bold"}). The bone rotates within this ring. Since the
rotation is around a single axis, pivot joints are functionally
classified as a uniaxial diarthrosis type of joint. An example of a
pivot joint is the atlantoaxial joint, found between the C1 (atlas) and
C2 (axis) vertebrae. Here, the upward projecting dens of the axis
articulates with the inner aspect of the atlas, where it is held in
place by a ligament. Rotation at this joint allows you to turn your head
from side to side. A second pivot joint is found at the <span
data-type="term">proximal radioulnar joint</span>. Here, the head of the
radius is largely encircled by a ligament that holds it in place as it
articulates with the radial notch of the ulna. Rotation of the radius
allows for forearm movements.
{: #fs-id1636208}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1399844" markdown="1">
## Hinge Joint
{: data-type="title"}

In a <span data-type="term">hinge joint</span>, the convex end of one
bone articulates with the concave end of the adjoining bone (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch09_04_03){: .autogenerated-content}**b**{:
data-effect="bold"}). This type of joint allows only for bending and
straightening motions along a single axis, and thus hinge joints are
functionally classified as uniaxial joints. A good example is the elbow
joint, with the articulation between the trochlea of the humerus and the
trochlear notch of the ulna. Other hinge joints of the body include the
knee, ankle, and interphalangeal joints between the phalanx bones of the
fingers and toes.
{: #fs-id2523908}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1415328" markdown="1">
## Condyloid Joint
{: data-type="title"}

At a <span data-type="term">condyloid joint</span> (ellipsoid joint),
the shallow depression at the end of one bone articulates with a rounded
structure from an adjacent bone or bones (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch09_04_03){: .autogenerated-content}**e**{:
data-effect="bold"}). The knuckle (metacarpophalangeal) joints of the
hand between the distal end of a metacarpal bone and the proximal
phalanx bone are condyloid joints. Another example is the radiocarpal
joint of the wrist, between the shallow depression at the distal end of
the radius bone and the rounded scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum carpal
bones. In this case, the articulation area has a more oval (elliptical)
shape. Functionally, condyloid joints are biaxial joints that allow for
two planes of movement. One movement involves the bending and
straightening of the fingers or the anterior-posterior movements of the
hand. The second movement is a side-to-side movement, which allows you
to spread your fingers apart and bring them together, or to move your
hand in a medial-going or lateral-going direction.
{: #fs-id1434553}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1413844" markdown="1">
## Saddle Joint
{: data-type="title"}

At a <span data-type="term">saddle joint</span>, both of the
articulating surfaces for the bones have a saddle shape, which is
concave in one direction and convex in the other (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch09_04_03){: .autogenerated-content}**c**{:
data-effect="bold"}). This allows the two bones to fit together like a
rider sitting on a saddle. Saddle joints are functionally classified as
biaxial joints. The primary example is the first carpometacarpal joint,
between the trapezium (a carpal bone) and the first metacarpal bone at
the base of the thumb. This joint provides the thumb the ability to move
away from the palm of the hand along two planes. Thus, the thumb can
move within the same plane as the palm of the hand, or it can jut out
anteriorly, perpendicular to the palm. This movement of the first
carpometacarpal joint is what gives humans their distinctive “opposable”
thumbs. The sternoclavicular joint is also classified as a saddle joint.
{: #fs-id1837120}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1764937" markdown="1">
## Plane Joint
{: data-type="title"}

At a <span data-type="term">plane joint</span> (gliding joint), the
articulating surfaces of the bones are flat or slightly curved and of
approximately the same size, which allows the bones to slide against
each other (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch09_04_03){:
.autogenerated-content}**d**{: data-effect="bold"}). The motion at this
type of joint is usually small and tightly constrained by surrounding
ligaments. Based only on their shape, plane joints can allow multiple
movements, including rotation. Thus plane joints can be functionally
classified as a multiaxial joint. However, not all of these movements
are available to every plane joint due to limitations placed on it by
ligaments or neighboring bones. Thus, depending upon the specific joint
of the body, a plane joint may exhibit only a single type of movement or
several movements. Plane joints are found between the carpal bones
(intercarpal joints) of the wrist or tarsal bones (intertarsal joints)
of the foot, between the clavicle and acromion of the scapula
(acromioclavicular joint), and between the superior and inferior
articular processes of adjacent vertebrae (zygapophysial joints).
{: #fs-id1482998}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1637016" markdown="1">
## Ball-and-Socket Joint
{: data-type="title"}

The joint with the greatest range of motion is the <span
data-type="term">ball-and-socket joint</span>. At these joints, the
rounded head of one bone (the ball) fits into the concave articulation
(the socket) of the adjacent bone (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch09_04_03){:
.autogenerated-content}**f**{: data-effect="bold"}). The hip joint and
the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint are the only ball-and-socket joints of
the body. At the hip joint, the head of the femur articulates with the
acetabulum of the hip bone, and at the shoulder joint, the head of the
humerus articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula.
{: #fs-id2110975}

Ball-and-socket joints are classified functionally as multiaxial joints.
The femur and the humerus are able to move in both anterior-posterior
and medial-lateral directions and they can also rotate around their long
axis. The shallow socket formed by the glenoid cavity allows the
shoulder joint an extensive range of motion. In contrast, the deep
socket of the acetabulum and the strong supporting ligaments of the hip
joint serve to constrain movements of the femur, reflecting the need for
stability and weight-bearing ability at the hip.

joint (radiocarpal joint of the wrist), saddle joint (first
carpometacarpal joint, between the trapezium carpal bone and the first
metacarpal bone, at the base of the thumb), and plane joint (facet

processes). Which type of synovial joint allows for the widest range of

Aging and the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Joints</span> Arthritis is a common disorder of
synovial joints that involves inflammation of the joint. This often
results in significant joint pain, along with swelling, stiffness, and
reduced joint mobility. There are more than 100 different forms of
arthritis. Arthritis may arise from aging, damage to the articular
cartilage, autoimmune diseases, bacterial or viral infections, or
unknown (probably genetic) causes.
{: #fs-id2041605}

The most common type of arthritis is osteoarthritis, which is associated
with aging and “wear and tear” of the articular cartilage
([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_04_04){: .autogenerated-content}). Risk factors
that may lead to osteoarthritis later in life include injury to a joint;
jobs that involve physical labor; sports with running, twisting, or
throwing actions; and being overweight. These factors put stress on the
articular cartilage that covers the surfaces of bones at synovial
joints, causing the cartilage to gradually become thinner. As the
articular cartilage layer wears down, more pressure is placed on the
bones. The joint responds by increasing production of the lubricating
synovial fluid, but this can lead to swelling of the joint cavity,
causing pain and joint stiffness as the articular capsule is stretched.
The bone tissue underlying the damaged articular cartilage also responds
by thickening, producing irregularities and causing the articulating
surface of the bone to become rough or bumpy. Joint movement then
results in pain and inflammation. In its early stages, symptoms of
osteoarthritis may be reduced by mild activity that “warms up” the
joint, but the symptoms may worsen following exercise. In individuals
with more advanced osteoarthritis, the affected joints can become more
painful and therefore are difficult to use effectively, resulting in
increased immobility. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but several
treatments can help alleviate the pain. Treatments may include lifestyle
changes, such as weight loss and low-impact exercise, and
over-the-counter or prescription medications that help to alleviate the
pain and inflammation. For severe cases, joint replacement surgery
(arthroplasty) may be required.
{: #fs-id1972005}

Joint replacement is a very invasive procedure, so other treatments are
always tried before surgery. However arthroplasty can provide relief
from chronic pain and can enhance mobility within a few months following
the surgery. This type of surgery involves replacing the articular
surfaces of the bones with prosthesis (artificial components). For
example, in hip arthroplasty, the worn or damaged parts of the hip
joint, including the head and neck of the femur and the acetabulum of
the pelvis, are removed and replaced with artificial joint components.
The replacement head for the femur consists of a rounded ball attached
to the end of a shaft that is inserted inside the diaphysis of the
femur. The acetabulum of the pelvis is reshaped and a replacement socket
is fitted into its place. The parts, which are always built in advance
of the surgery, are sometimes custom made to produce the best possible
fit for a patient.
{: #fs-id2325758}

Gout is a form of arthritis that results from the deposition of uric
acid crystals within a body joint. Usually only one or a few joints are
affected, such as the big toe, knee, or ankle. The attack may only last
a few days, but may return to the same or another joint. Gout occurs
when the body makes too much uric acid or the kidneys do not properly
excrete it. A diet with excessive fructose has been implicated in
raising the chances of a susceptible individual developing gout.
{: #fs-id1720678}

Other forms of arthritis are associated with various autoimmune
diseases, bacterial infections of the joint, or unknown genetic causes.
Autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or
systemic lupus erythematosus, produce arthritis because the immune
system of the body attacks the body joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, the
joint capsule and synovial membrane become inflamed. As the disease
progresses, the articular cartilage is severely damaged or destroyed,
resulting in joint deformation, loss of movement, and severe disability.
The most commonly involved joints are the hands, feet, and cervical
spine, with corresponding joints on both sides of the body usually
affected, though not always to the same extent. Rheumatoid arthritis is
also associated with lung fibrosis, vasculitis (inflammation of blood
vessels), coronary heart disease, and premature mortality. With no known
cure, treatments are aimed at alleviating symptoms. Exercise,
anti-inflammatory and pain medications, various specific
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or surgery are used to treat
rheumatoid arthritis.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Synovial joints are the most common type of joints in the body. They are
characterized by the presence of a joint cavity, inside of which the
bones of the joint articulate with each other. The articulating surfaces
of the bones at a synovial joint are not directly connected to each
other by connective tissue or cartilage, which allows the bones to move
freely against each other. The walls of the joint cavity are formed by
the articular capsule. Friction between the bones is reduced by a thin
layer of articular cartilage covering the surfaces of the bones, and by
a lubricating synovial fluid, which is secreted by the synovial
membrane.
{: #fs-id1407230}

Synovial joints are strengthened by the presence of ligaments, which
hold the bones together and resist excessive or abnormal movements of
the joint. Ligaments are classified as extrinsic ligaments if they are
located outside of the articular capsule, intrinsic ligaments if they
are fused to the wall of the articular capsule, or intracapsular
ligaments if they are located inside the articular capsule. Some
synovial joints also have an articular disc (meniscus), which can
provide padding between the bones, smooth their movements, or strongly
join the bones together to strengthen the joint. Muscles and their
tendons acting across a joint can also increase their contractile
strength when needed, thus providing indirect support for the joint.
{: #fs-id2327941}

Bursae contain a lubricating fluid that serves to reduce friction
between structures. Subcutaneous bursae prevent friction between the
skin and an underlying bone, submuscular bursae protect muscles from
rubbing against a bone or another muscle, and a subtendinous bursa
prevents friction between bone and a muscle tendon. Tendon sheaths
contain a lubricating fluid and surround tendons to allow for smooth
movement of the tendon as it crosses a joint.

Based on the shape of the articulating bone surfaces and the types of
movement allowed, synovial joints are classified into six types. At a
pivot joint, one bone is held within a ring by a ligament and its
articulation with a second bone. Pivot joints only allow for rotation
around a single axis. These are found at the articulation between the C1
(atlas) and the dens of the C2 (axis) vertebrae, which provides the
side-to-side rotation of the head, or at the proximal radioulnar joint
between the head of the radius and the radial notch of the ulna, which
allows for rotation of the radius during forearm movements. Hinge
joints, such as at the elbow, knee, ankle, or interphalangeal joints
between phalanx bones of the fingers and toes, allow only for bending
and straightening of the joint. Pivot and hinge joints are functionally
classified as uniaxial joints.
{: #fs-id2250444}

Condyloid joints are found where the shallow depression of one bone
receives a rounded bony area formed by one or two bones. Condyloid
joints are found at the base of the fingers (metacarpophalangeal joints)
and at the wrist (radiocarpal joint). At a saddle joint, the
articulating bones fit together like a rider and a saddle. An example is
the first carpometacarpal joint located at the base of the thumb. Both
condyloid and saddle joints are functionally classified as biaxial
joints.
{: #fs-id1616514}

Plane joints are formed between the small, flattened surfaces of
adjacent bones. These joints allow the bones to slide or rotate against
each other, but the range of motion is usually slight and tightly
limited by ligaments or surrounding bones. This type of joint is found
between the articular processes of adjacent vertebrae, at the
acromioclavicular joint, or at the intercarpal joints of the hand and
intertarsal joints of the foot. Ball-and-socket joints, in which the
rounded head of a bone fits into a large depression or socket, are found
at the shoulder and hip joints. Both plane and ball-and-sockets joints
are classified functionally as multiaxial joints. However,
ball-and-socket joints allow for large movements, while the motions
between bones at a plane joint are small.

Watch this [video][1] to see an animation of synovial joints in action.
Synovial joints are places where bones articulate with each other inside
of a joint cavity. The different types of synovial joints are the
ball-and-socket joint (shoulder joint), hinge joint (knee), pivot joint
(atlantoaxial joint, between C1 and C2 vertebrae of the neck), condyloid
joint (radiocarpal joint of the wrist), saddle joint (first
carpometacarpal joint, between the trapezium carpal bone and the first
metacarpal bone, at the base of the thumb), and plane joint (facet
joints of vertebral column, between superior and inferior articular
processes). Which type of synovial joint allows for the widest ranges of
motion?

Describe the characteristic structures found at all synovial joints.
{: #fs-id1381084}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1761546" data-label="" markdown="1">
All synovial joints have a joint cavity filled with synovial fluid that
is the site at which the bones of the joint articulate with each other.
The articulating surfaces of the bones are covered by articular
cartilage, a thin layer of hyaline cartilage. The walls of the joint
cavity are formed by the connective tissue of the articular capsule. The
synovial membrane lines the interior surface of the joint cavity and
secretes the synovial fluid. Synovial joints are directly supported by
ligaments, which span between the bones of the joint. These may be
located outside of the articular capsule (extrinsic ligaments),
incorporated or fused to the wall of the articular capsule (intrinsic
ligaments), or found inside of the articular capsule (intracapsular
ligaments). Ligaments hold the bones together and also serve to resist
or prevent excessive or abnormal movements of the joint.

Describe the structures that provide direct and indirect support for a
synovial joint.
{: #fs-id2239592}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id2226860" data-label="" markdown="1">
Direct support for a synovial joint is provided by ligaments that
strongly unite the bones of the joint and serve to resist excessive or
abnormal movements. Some joints, such as the sternoclavicular joint,
have an articular disc that is attached to both bones, where it provides
direct support by holding the bones together. Indirect joint support is
provided by the muscles and their tendons that act across a joint.
Muscles will increase their contractile force to help support the joint
by resisting forces acting on it.
