</div>
The body contains a large variety of ions, or electrolytes, which
perform a variety of functions. Some ions assist in the transmission of
electrical impulses along cell membranes in neurons and muscles. Other
ions help to stabilize protein structures in enzymes. Still others aid
in releasing hormones from endocrine glands. All of the ions in plasma
contribute to the osmotic balance that controls the movement of water
between cells and their environment.
{: #fs-id1932370}

Electrolytes in living systems include sodium, potassium, chloride,
bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, copper, zinc, iron,
manganese, molybdenum, copper, and chromium. In terms of body
functioning, six electrolytes are most important: sodium, potassium,
chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, and phosphate.

# Roles of Electrolytes
{: data-type="title"}

These six ions aid in nerve excitability, endocrine secretion, membrane
permeability, buffering body fluids, and controlling the movement of
fluids between compartments. These ions enter the body through the
digestive tract. More than 90 percent of the calcium and phosphate that
enters the body is incorporated into bones and teeth, with bone serving
as a mineral reserve for these ions. In the event that calcium and
phosphate are needed for other functions, bone tissue can be broken down
to supply the blood and other tissues with these minerals. Phosphate is
a normal constituent of nucleic acids; hence, blood levels of phosphate
will increase whenever nucleic acids are broken down.
{: #fs-id1616324}

Excretion of ions occurs mainly through the kidneys, with lesser amounts
lost in sweat and in feces. Excessive sweating may cause a significant
loss, especially of sodium and chloride. Severe vomiting or diarrhea
will cause a loss of chloride and bicarbonate ions. Adjustments in
respiratory and renal functions allow the body to regulate the levels of
these ions in the ECF.
{: #fs-id2005214}

[\[link\]](#tbl-ch27_01){: .autogenerated-content} lists the reference
values for blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine for the
six ions addressed in this section. In a clinical setting, sodium,
potassium, and chloride are typically analyzed in a routine urine
sample. In contrast, calcium and phosphate analysis requires a
collection of urine across a 24-hour period, because the output of these
ions can vary considerably over the course of a day. Urine values
reflect the rates of excretion of these ions. Bicarbonate is the one ion
that is not normally excreted in urine; instead, it is conserved by the
kidneys for use in the body’s buffering systems.

## Sodium
{: data-type="title"}

Sodium is the major cation of the extracellular fluid. It is responsible
for one-half of the osmotic pressure gradient that exists between the
interior of cells and their surrounding environment. People eating a
typical Western diet, which is very high in NaCl, routinely take in 130
to 160 mmol/day of sodium, but humans require only 1 to 2 mmol/day. This
excess sodium appears to be a major factor in hypertension (high blood
pressure) in some people. Excretion of sodium is accomplished primarily
by the kidneys. Sodium is freely filtered through the glomerular
capillaries of the kidneys, and although much of the filtered sodium is
reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule, some remains in the
filtrate and urine, and is normally excreted.
{: #fs-id1926607}

<span data-type="term">Hyponatremia</span> is a lower-than-normal
concentration of sodium, usually associated with excess water
accumulation in the body, which dilutes the sodium. An absolute loss of
sodium may be due to a decreased intake of the ion coupled with its
continual excretion in the urine. An abnormal loss of sodium from the
body can result from several conditions, including excessive sweating,
vomiting, or diarrhea; the use of diuretics; excessive production of
urine, which can occur in diabetes; and acidosis, either metabolic
acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis.
{: #fs-id1373472}

A relative decrease in blood sodium can occur because of an imbalance of
sodium in one of the body’s other fluid compartments, like IF, or from a
dilution of sodium due to water retention related to edema or congestive
heart failure. At the cellular level, hyponatremia results in increased
entry of water into cells by osmosis, because the concentration of
solutes within the cell exceeds the concentration of solutes in the
now-diluted ECF. The excess water causes swelling of the cells; the
swelling of red blood cells—decreasing their oxygen-carrying efficiency
and making them potentially too large to fit through capillaries—along
with the swelling of neurons in the brain can result in brain damage or
even death.
{: #fs-id1905815}

<span data-type="term">Hypernatremia</span> is an abnormal increase of
blood sodium. It can result from water loss from the blood, resulting in
the hemoconcentration of all blood constituents. Hormonal imbalances
involving ADH and aldosterone may also result in higher-than-normal
sodium values.
{: #fs-id1928598}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1885998" markdown="1">
## Potassium
{: data-type="title"}

Potassium is the major intracellular cation. It helps establish the
resting membrane potential in neurons and muscle fibers after membrane
depolarization and action potentials. In contrast to sodium, potassium
has very little effect on osmotic pressure. The low levels of potassium
in blood and CSF are due to the sodium-potassium pumps in cell
membranes, which maintain the normal potassium concentration gradients
between the ICF and ECF. The recommendation for daily intake/consumption
of potassium is 4700 mg. Potassium is excreted, both actively and
passively, through the renal tubules, especially the distal convoluted
tubule and collecting ducts. Potassium participates in the exchange with
sodium in the renal tubules under the influence of aldosterone, which
also relies on basolateral sodium-potassium pumps.
{: #fs-id2020926}

<span data-type="term">Hypokalemia</span> is an abnormally low potassium
blood level. Similar to the situation with hyponatremia, hypokalemia can
occur because of either an absolute reduction of potassium in the body
or a relative reduction of potassium in the blood due to the
redistribution of potassium. An absolute loss of potassium can arise
from decreased intake, frequently related to starvation. It can also
come about from vomiting, diarrhea, or alkalosis.
{: #fs-id1254689}

Some insulin-dependent diabetic patients experience a relative reduction
of potassium in the blood from the redistribution of potassium. When
insulin is administered and glucose is taken up by cells, potassium
passes through the cell membrane along with glucose, decreasing the
amount of potassium in the blood and IF, which can cause
hyperpolarization of the cell membranes of neurons, reducing their
responses to stimuli.
{: #fs-id2017563}

<span data-type="term">Hyperkalemia</span>, an elevated potassium blood
level, also can impair the function of skeletal muscles, the nervous
system, and the heart. Hyperkalemia can result from increased dietary
intake of potassium. In such a situation, potassium from the blood ends
up in the ECF in abnormally high concentrations. This can result in a
partial depolarization (excitation) of the plasma membrane of skeletal
muscle fibers, neurons, and cardiac cells of the heart, and can also
lead to an inability of cells to repolarize. For the heart, this means
that it won’t relax after a contraction, and will effectively “seize”
and stop pumping blood, which is fatal within minutes. Because of such
effects on the nervous system, a person with hyperkalemia may also
exhibit mental confusion, numbness, and weakened respiratory muscles.

## Chloride
{: data-type="title"}

Chloride is the predominant extracellular anion. Chloride is a major
contributor to the osmotic pressure gradient between the ICF and ECF,
and plays an important role in maintaining proper hydration. Chloride
functions to balance cations in the ECF, maintaining the electrical
neutrality of this fluid. The paths of secretion and reabsorption of
chloride ions in the renal system follow the paths of sodium ions.
{: #fs-id1378888}

<span data-type="term">Hypochloremia</span>, or lower-than-normal blood
chloride levels, can occur because of defective renal tubular
absorption. Vomiting, diarrhea, and metabolic acidosis can also lead to
hypochloremia. <span data-type="term">Hyperchloremia</span>, or
higher-than-normal blood chloride levels, can occur due to dehydration,
excessive intake of dietary salt (NaCl) or swallowing of sea water,
aspirin intoxication, congestive heart failure, and the hereditary,
chronic lung disease, cystic fibrosis. In people who have cystic
fibrosis, chloride levels in sweat are two to five times those of normal
levels, and analysis of sweat is often used in the diagnosis of the
disease.

## Bicarbonate
{: data-type="title"}

Bicarbonate is the second most abundant anion in the blood. Its
principal function is to maintain your body’s acid-base balance by being
part of buffer systems. This role will be discussed in a different
section.
{: #fs-id1968819}

Bicarbonate ions result from a chemical reaction that starts with carbon
dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water, two molecules that are produced at
the end of aerobic metabolism. Only a small amount of CO<sub>2</sub> can
be dissolved in body fluids. Thus, over 90 percent of the CO<sub>2</sub>
is converted into bicarbonate ions, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>, through
the following reactions:
{: #fs-id1721298}

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-287">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"> <mrow> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>CO</mtext> </mrow> <mtext>2</mtext> </msub> <msub> <mrow> <mtext> + H</mtext> </mrow> <mtext>2</mtext> </msub> <mtext>O</mtext> <mrow><mo stretchy="false">↔</mo></mrow> <msub> <mtext>H</mtext> <mtext>2</mtext> </msub> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>CO</mtext> </mrow> <mtext>3</mtext> </msub> <mrow><mo stretchy="false">↔</mo></mrow> <msub> <mtext>H</mtext> <mtext>2</mtext> </msub> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>CO</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mtext>3-</mtext> </mrow> </msub> <msup> <mrow> <mtext> + H</mtext> </mrow> <mtext>+</mtext> </msup> </mrow> </math>
</div>
The bidirectional arrows indicate that the reactions can go in either
direction, depending on the concentrations of the reactants and
products. Carbon dioxide is produced in large amounts in tissues that
have a high metabolic rate. Carbon dioxide is converted into bicarbonate
in the cytoplasm of red blood cells through the action of an enzyme
called carbonic anhydrase. Bicarbonate is transported in the blood. Once
in the lungs, the reactions reverse direction, and CO<sub>2</sub> is
regenerated from bicarbonate to be exhaled as metabolic waste.

## Calcium
{: data-type="title"}

About two pounds of calcium in your body are bound up in bone, which
provides hardness to the bone and serves as a mineral reserve for
calcium and its salts for the rest of the tissues. Teeth also have a
high concentration of calcium within them. A little more than one-half
of blood calcium is bound to proteins, leaving the rest in its ionized
form. Calcium ions, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, are necessary for muscle
contraction, enzyme activity, and blood coagulation. In addition,
calcium helps to stabilize cell membranes and is essential for the
release of neurotransmitters from neurons and of hormones from endocrine
glands.
{: #fs-id2003025}

Calcium is absorbed through the intestines under the influence of
activated vitamin D. A deficiency of vitamin D leads to a decrease in
absorbed calcium and, eventually, a depletion of calcium stores from the
skeletal system, potentially leading to rickets in children and
osteomalacia in adults, contributing to osteoporosis.

<span data-type="term">Hypocalcemia</span>, or abnormally low calcium
blood levels, is seen in hypoparathyroidism, which may follow the

. Bone and teeth bind up 85 percent of the body’s phosphate as part of
calcium-phosphate salts. Phosphate is found in phospholipids, such as
those that make up the cell membrane, and in ATP, nucleotides, and
buffers.
{: #fs-id1938090}

<span data-type="term">Hypophosphatemia</span>, or abnormally low
phosphate blood levels, occurs with heavy use of antacids, during
alcohol withdrawal, and during malnourishment. In the face of phosphate
depletion, the kidneys usually conserve phosphate, but during
starvation, this conservation is impaired greatly. <span
data-type="term">Hyperphosphatemia</span>, or abnormally increased
levels of phosphates in the blood, occurs if there is decreased renal
function or in cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia. Additionally,
because phosphate is a major constituent of the ICF, any significant
destruction of cells can result in dumping of phosphate into the ECF.

# Regulation of Sodium and Potassium
{: data-type="title"}

Sodium is reabsorbed from the renal filtrate, and potassium is excreted
into the filtrate in the renal collecting tubule. The control of this
exchange is governed principally by two hormones—aldosterone and
angiotensin II.
{: #fs-id1883272}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1760759" markdown="1">
## Aldosterone
{: data-type="title"}

Recall that aldosterone increases the excretion of potassium and the
reabsorption of sodium in the distal tubule. Aldosterone is released if
blood levels of potassium increase, if blood levels of sodium severely
decrease, or if blood pressure decreases. Its net effect is to conserve
and increase water levels in the plasma by reducing the excretion of
sodium, and thus water, from the kidneys. In a negative feedback loop,
increased osmolality of the ECF (which follows aldosterone-stimulated
sodium absorption) inhibits the release of the hormone
([\[link\]](#fig-ch27_03_01){: .autogenerated-content}).

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1720583" markdown="1">
## Angiotensin II
{: data-type="title"}

Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and an increase in systemic blood
pressure. This action increases the glomerular filtration rate,
resulting in more material filtered out of the glomerular capillaries
and into Bowman’s capsule. Angiotensin II also signals an increase in
the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex.
{: #fs-id1645617}

In the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys,
aldosterone stimulates the synthesis and activation of the
sodium-potassium pump ([\[link\]](#fig-ch27_03_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). Sodium passes from the filtrate, into and
through the cells of the tubules and ducts, into the ECF and then into
capillaries. Water follows the sodium due to osmosis. Thus, aldosterone
causes an increase in blood sodium levels and blood volume.
Aldosterone’s effect on potassium is the reverse of that of sodium;
under its influence, excess potassium is pumped into the renal filtrate
for excretion from the body.

# Regulation of Calcium and Phosphate
{: data-type="title"}

Calcium and phosphate are both regulated through the actions of three
hormones: parathyroid hormone (PTH), dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol),
and calcitonin. All three are released or synthesized in response to the
blood levels of calcium.
{: #fs-id1879782}

PTH is released from the parathyroid gland in response to a decrease in
the concentration of blood calcium. The hormone activates osteoclasts to
break down bone matrix and release inorganic calcium-phosphate salts.
PTH also increases the gastrointestinal absorption of dietary calcium by
converting vitamin D into <span data-type="term">dihydroxyvitamin
D</span> (calcitriol), an active form of vitamin D that intestinal
epithelial cells require to absorb calcium.
{: #fs-id1886730}

PTH raises blood calcium levels by inhibiting the loss of calcium
through the kidneys. PTH also increases the loss of phosphate through
the kidneys.
{: #fs-id1632421}

Calcitonin is released from the thyroid gland in response to elevated
blood levels of calcium. The hormone increases the activity of
osteoblasts, which remove calcium from the blood and incorporate calcium
into the bony matrix.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Electrolytes serve various purposes, such as helping to conduct
electrical impulses along cell membranes in neurons and muscles,
stabilizing enzyme structures, and releasing hormones from endocrine
glands. The ions in plasma also contribute to the osmotic balance that
controls the movement of water between cells and their environment.
Imbalances of these ions can result in various problems in the body, and
their concentrations are tightly regulated. Aldosterone and angiotensin
II control the exchange of sodium and potassium between the renal
filtrate and the renal collecting tubule. Calcium and phosphate are
regulated by PTH, calcitrol, and calcitonin.

Very little of the carbon dioxide in the blood is carried dissolved in
the plasma. It is transformed into carbonic acid and then into
bicarbonate in order to mix in plasma for transportation to the lungs,
where it reverts back to its gaseous form.

How can one have an imbalance in a substance, but not actually have
elevated or deficient levels of that substance in the body?
{: #fs-id1361021}

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1574141" data-label="" markdown="1">
Without having an absolute excess or deficiency of a substance, one can
have too much or too little of that substance in a given compartment.
Such a relative increase or decrease is due to a redistribution of water
or the ion in the body’s compartments. This may be due to the loss of
water in the blood, leading to a hemoconcentration or dilution of the
ion in tissues due to edema.
