Blood is carried through the body via blood vessels. An artery is a
blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart, where it branches
into ever-smaller vessels. Eventually, the smallest arteries, vessels
called arterioles, further branch into tiny capillaries, where nutrients
and wastes are exchanged, and then combine with other vessels that exit
capillaries to form venules, small blood vessels that carry blood to a
vein, a larger blood vessel that returns blood to the heart.
{: #fs-id1303930}

Arteries and veins transport blood in two distinct circuits: the
systemic circuit and the pulmonary circuit
([\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_01){: .autogenerated-content}). Systemic
arteries provide blood rich in oxygen to the body’s tissues. The blood
returned to the heart through systemic veins has less oxygen, since much
of the oxygen carried by the arteries has been delivered to the cells.
In contrast, in the pulmonary circuit, arteries carry blood low in
oxygen exclusively to the lungs for gas exchange. Pulmonary veins then
return freshly oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart to be pumped
back out into systemic circulation. Although arteries and veins differ
structurally and functionally, they share certain features.

direction of blood flow, and the colors show the relative levels of

# Shared Structures
{: data-type="title"}

Different types of blood vessels vary slightly in their structures, but
they share the same general features. Arteries and arterioles have
thicker walls than veins and venules because they are closer to the
heart and receive blood that is surging at a far greater pressure
([\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_02){: .autogenerated-content}). Each type of
vessel has a <span data-type="term">lumen</span>—a hollow passageway
through which blood flows. Arteries have smaller lumens than veins, a
characteristic that helps to maintain the pressure of blood moving
through the system. Together, their thicker walls and smaller diameters
give arterial lumens a more rounded appearance in cross section than the
lumens of veins.

</figure>
By the time blood has passed through capillaries and entered venules,
the pressure initially exerted upon it by heart contractions has
diminished. In other words, in comparison to arteries, venules and veins
withstand a much lower pressure from the blood that flows through them.
Their walls are considerably thinner and their lumens are
correspondingly larger in diameter, allowing more blood to flow with
less vessel resistance. In addition, many veins of the body,
particularly those of the limbs, contain valves that assist the
unidirectional flow of blood toward the heart. This is critical because
blood flow becomes sluggish in the extremities, as a result of the lower
pressure and the effects of gravity.
{: #fs-id1610522}

The walls of arteries and veins are largely composed of living cells and
their products (including collagenous and elastic fibers); the cells
require nourishment and produce waste. Since blood passes through the
larger vessels relatively quickly, there is limited opportunity for
blood in the lumen of the vessel to provide nourishment to or remove
waste from the vessel’s cells. Further, the walls of the larger vessels
are too thick for nutrients to diffuse through to all of the cells.
Larger arteries and veins contain small blood vessels within their walls
known as the <span data-type="term">vasa vasorum</span>—literally
“vessels of the vessel”—to provide them with this critical exchange.
Since the pressure within arteries is relatively high, the vasa vasorum
must function in the outer layers of the vessel (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_02){: .autogenerated-content}) or the pressure
exerted by the blood passing through the vessel would collapse it,
preventing any exchange from occurring. The lower pressure within veins
allows the vasa vasorum to be located closer to the lumen. The
restriction of the vasa vasorum to the outer layers of arteries is
thought to be one reason that arterial diseases are more common than
venous diseases, since its location makes it more difficult to nourish
the cells of the arteries and remove waste products. There are also
minute nerves within the walls of both types of vessels that control the
contraction and dilation of smooth muscle. These minute nerves are known
as the nervi vasorum.
{: #fs-id2489067}

Both arteries and veins have the same three distinct tissue layers,
called tunics (from the Latin term tunica), for the garments first worn
by ancient Romans; the term tunic is also used for some modern garments.
From the most interior layer to the outer, these tunics are the tunica
intima, the tunica media, and the tunica externa (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_02){: .autogenerated-content}).
[\[link\]](#tbl-ch21_01){: .autogenerated-content} compares and
contrasts the tunics of the arteries and veins.

## Tunica Intima
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">tunica intima</span> (also called the tunica
interna) is composed of epithelial and connective tissue layers. Lining
the tunica intima is the specialized simple squamous epithelium called
the endothelium, which is continuous throughout the entire vascular
system, including the lining of the chambers of the heart. Damage to
this endothelial lining and exposure of blood to the collagenous fibers
beneath is one of the primary causes of clot formation. Until recently,
the endothelium was viewed simply as the boundary between the blood in
the lumen and the walls of the vessels. Recent studies, however, have
shown that it is physiologically critical to such activities as helping
to regulate capillary exchange and altering blood flow. The endothelium
releases local chemicals called endothelins that can constrict the
smooth muscle within the walls of the vessel to increase blood pressure.
Uncompensated overproduction of endothelins may contribute to
hypertension (high blood pressure) and cardiovascular disease.
{: #fs-id1296396}

Next to the endothelium is the basement membrane, or basal lamina, that
effectively binds the endothelium to the connective tissue. The basement
membrane provides strength while maintaining flexibility, and it is
permeable, allowing materials to pass through it. The thin outer layer
of the tunica intima contains a small amount of areolar connective
tissue that consists primarily of elastic fibers to provide the vessel
with additional flexibility; it also contains some collagenous fibers to
provide additional strength.
{: #fs-id1307443}

In larger arteries, there is also a thick, distinct layer of elastic
fibers known as the <span data-type="term">internal elastic
membrane</span> (also called the internal elastic lamina) at the
boundary with the tunica media. Like the other components of the tunica
intima, the internal elastic membrane provides structure while allowing
the vessel to stretch. It is permeated with small openings that allow
exchange of materials between the tunics. The internal elastic membrane
is not apparent in veins. In addition, many veins, particularly in the
lower limbs, contain valves formed by sections of thickened endothelium
that are reinforced with connective tissue, extending into the lumen.
{: #fs-id649400}

Under the microscope, the lumen and the entire tunica intima of a vein
will appear smooth, whereas those of an artery will normally appear wavy
because of the partial constriction of the smooth muscle in the tunica
media, the next layer of blood vessel walls.
{: #fs-id1547694}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1588568" markdown="1">
## Tunica Media
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">tunica media</span> is the substantial middle
layer of the vessel wall (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). It is generally the thickest layer in
arteries, and it is much thicker in arteries than it is in veins. The
tunica media consists of layers of smooth muscle supported by connective
tissue that is primarily made up of elastic fibers, most of which are
arranged in circular sheets. Toward the outer portion of the tunic,
there are also layers of longitudinal muscle. Contraction and relaxation
of the circular muscles decrease and increase the diameter of the vessel
lumen, respectively. Specifically in arteries, <span
data-type="term">vasoconstriction</span> decreases blood flow as the
smooth muscle in the walls of the tunica media contracts, making the
lumen narrower and increasing blood pressure. Similarly, <span
data-type="term">vasodilation</span> increases blood flow as the smooth
muscle relaxes, allowing the lumen to widen and blood pressure to drop.
Both vasoconstriction and vasodilation are regulated in part by small
vascular nerves, known as <span data-type="term">nervi vasorum</span>,
or “nerves of the vessel,” that run within the walls of blood vessels.
These are generally all sympathetic fibers, although some trigger
vasodilation and others induce vasoconstriction, depending upon the
nature of the neurotransmitter and receptors located on the target cell.
Parasympathetic stimulation does trigger vasodilation as well as
erection during sexual arousal in the external genitalia of both sexes.
Nervous control over vessels tends to be more generalized than the
specific targeting of individual blood vessels. Local controls,
discussed later, account for this phenomenon. (Seek additional content
for more information on these dynamic aspects of the autonomic nervous
system.) Hormones and local chemicals also control blood vessels.
Together, these neural and chemical mechanisms reduce or increase blood
flow in response to changing body conditions, from exercise to
hydration. Regulation of both blood flow and blood pressure is discussed
in detail later in this chapter.
{: #fs-id1279392}

The smooth muscle layers of the tunica media are supported by a
framework of collagenous fibers that also binds the tunica media to the
inner and outer tunics. Along with the collagenous fibers are large
numbers of elastic fibers that appear as wavy lines in prepared slides.
Separating the tunica media from the outer tunica externa in larger
arteries is the <span data-type="term">external elastic membrane</span>
(also called the external elastic lamina), which also appears wavy in
slides. This structure is not usually seen in smaller arteries, nor is
it seen in veins.

## Tunica Externa
{: data-type="title"}

The outer tunic, the <span data-type="term">tunica externa</span> (also
called the tunica adventitia), is a substantial sheath of connective
tissue composed primarily of collagenous fibers. Some bands of elastic
fibers are found here as well. The tunica externa in veins also contains
groups of smooth muscle fibers. This is normally the thickest tunic in
veins and may be thicker than the tunica media in some larger arteries.
The outer layers of the tunica externa are not distinct but rather blend
with the surrounding connective tissue outside the vessel, helping to
hold the vessel in relative position. If you are able to palpate some of
the superficial veins on your upper limbs and try to move them, you will
find that the tunica externa prevents this. If the tunica externa did
not hold the vessel in place, any movement would likely result in
disruption of blood flow.

# Arteries
{: data-type="title"}

An <span data-type="term">artery</span> is a blood vessel that conducts
blood away from the heart. All arteries have relatively thick walls that
can withstand the high pressure of blood ejected from the heart.
However, those close to the heart have the thickest walls, containing a
high percentage of elastic fibers in all three of their tunics. This
type of artery is known as an <span data-type="term">elastic
artery</span> ([\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_03){: .autogenerated-content}).
Vessels larger than 10 mm in diameter are typically elastic. Their
abundant elastic fibers allow them to expand, as blood pumped from the
ventricles passes through them, and then to recoil after the surge has
passed. If artery walls were rigid and unable to expand and recoil,
their resistance to blood flow would greatly increase and blood pressure
would rise to even higher levels, which would in turn require the heart
to pump harder to increase the volume of blood expelled by each pump
(the stroke volume) and maintain adequate pressure and flow. Artery
walls would have to become even thicker in response to this increased
pressure. The elastic recoil of the vascular wall helps to maintain the
pressure gradient that drives the blood through the arterial system. An
elastic artery is also known as a conducting artery, because the large
diameter of the lumen enables it to accept a large volume of blood from
the heart and conduct it to smaller branches.

data-media-type="image/jpg" width="550"} </span>
</figure>
Farther from the heart, where the surge of blood has dampened, the
percentage of elastic fibers in an artery’s tunica intima decreases and
the amount of smooth muscle in its tunica media increases. The artery at
this point is described as a <span data-type="term">muscular
artery</span>. The diameter of muscular arteries typically ranges from
0.1 mm to 10 mm. Their thick tunica media allows muscular arteries to
play a leading role in vasoconstriction. In contrast, their decreased
quantity of elastic fibers limits their ability to expand. Fortunately,
because the blood pressure has eased by the time it reaches these more
distant vessels, elasticity has become less important.
{: #fs-id1268037}

Notice that although the distinctions between elastic and muscular
arteries are important, there is no “line of demarcation” where an
elastic artery suddenly becomes muscular. Rather, there is a gradual
transition as the vascular tree repeatedly branches. In turn, muscular
arteries branch to distribute blood to the vast network of arterioles.
For this reason, a muscular artery is also known as a distributing
artery.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1468885" markdown="1">
# Arterioles
{: data-type="title"}

An <span data-type="term">arteriole</span> is a very small artery that
leads to a capillary. Arterioles have the same three tunics as the
larger vessels, but the thickness of each is greatly diminished. The
critical endothelial lining of the tunica intima is intact. The tunica
media is restricted to one or two smooth muscle cell layers in
thickness. The tunica externa remains but is very thin (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_03){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1608664}

With a lumen averaging 30 micrometers or less in diameter, arterioles
are critical in slowing down—or resisting—blood flow and, thus, causing
a substantial drop in blood pressure. Because of this, you may see them
referred to as resistance vessels. The muscle fibers in arterioles are
normally slightly contracted, causing arterioles to maintain a
consistent muscle tone—in this case referred to as vascular tone—in a
similar manner to the muscular tone of skeletal muscle. In reality, all
blood vessels exhibit vascular tone due to the partial contraction of
smooth muscle. The importance of the arterioles is that they will be the
primary site of both resistance and regulation of blood pressure. The
precise diameter of the lumen of an arteriole at any given moment is
determined by neural and chemical controls, and vasoconstriction and
vasodilation in the arterioles are the primary mechanisms for
distribution of blood flow.

# Capillaries
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">capillary</span> is a microscopic channel that
supplies blood to the tissues themselves, a process called <span
data-type="term">perfusion</span>. Exchange of gases and other
substances occurs in the capillaries between the blood and the
surrounding cells and their tissue fluid (interstitial fluid). The
diameter of a capillary lumen ranges from 5–10 micrometers; the smallest
are just barely wide enough for an erythrocyte to squeeze through. Flow
through capillaries is often described as <span
data-type="term">microcirculation</span>.
{: #fs-id1990038}

The wall of a capillary consists of the endothelial layer surrounded by
a basement membrane with occasional smooth muscle fibers. There is some
variation in wall structure: In a large capillary, several endothelial
cells bordering each other may line the lumen; in a small capillary,
there may be only a single cell layer that wraps around to contact
itself.
{: #fs-id2472463}

For capillaries to function, their walls must be leaky, allowing
substances to pass through. There are three major types of capillaries,
which differ according to their degree of “leakiness:” continuous,
fenestrated, and sinusoid capillaries ([\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_04){:
.autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1371059}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1721006" markdown="1">
## Continuous Capillaries
{: data-type="title"}

The most common type of capillary, the <span data-type="term">continuous
capillary</span>, is found in almost all vascularized tissues.
Continuous capillaries are characterized by a complete endothelial
lining with tight junctions between endothelial cells. Although a tight
junction is usually impermeable and only allows for the passage of water
and ions, they are often incomplete in capillaries, leaving
intercellular clefts that allow for exchange of water and other very
small molecules between the blood plasma and the interstitial fluid.
Substances that can pass between cells include metabolic products, such
as glucose, water, and small hydrophobic molecules like gases and
hormones, as well as various leukocytes. Continuous capillaries not
associated with the brain are rich in transport vesicles, contributing
to either endocytosis or exocytosis. Those in the brain are part of the
blood-brain barrier. Here, there are tight junctions and no
intercellular clefts, plus a thick basement membrane and astrocyte
extensions called end feet; these structures combine to prevent the
movement of nearly all substances.

## Fenestrated Capillaries
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">fenestrated capillary</span> is one that has
pores (or fenestrations) in addition to tight junctions in the
endothelial lining. These make the capillary permeable to larger
molecules. The number of fenestrations and their degree of permeability
vary, however, according to their location. Fenestrated capillaries are
common in the small intestine, which is the primary site of nutrient
absorption, as well as in the kidneys, which filter the blood. They are
also found in the choroid plexus of the brain and many endocrine
structures, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, and thyroid
glands.
{: #fs-id1984639}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2150378" markdown="1">
## Sinusoid Capillaries
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">sinusoid capillary</span> (or sinusoid) is the
least common type of capillary. Sinusoid capillaries are flattened, and
they have extensive intercellular gaps and incomplete basement
membranes, in addition to intercellular clefts and fenestrations. This
gives them an appearance not unlike Swiss cheese. These very large
openings allow for the passage of the largest molecules, including
plasma proteins and even cells. Blood flow through sinusoids is very
slow, allowing more time for exchange of gases, nutrients, and wastes.
Sinusoids are found in the liver and spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes
(where they carry lymph, not blood), and many endocrine glands including
the pituitary and adrenal glands. Without these specialized capillaries,
these organs would not be able to provide their myriad of functions. For
example, when bone marrow forms new blood cells, the cells must enter
the blood supply and can only do so through the large openings of a
sinusoid capillary; they cannot pass through the small openings of
continuous or fenestrated capillaries. The liver also requires extensive
specialized sinusoid capillaries in order to process the materials
brought to it by the hepatic portal vein from both the digestive tract
and spleen, and to release plasma proteins into circulation.

# Metarterioles and Capillary Beds
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">metarteriole</span> is a type of vessel that
has structural characteristics of both an arteriole and a capillary.
Slightly larger than the typical capillary, the smooth muscle of the
tunica media of the metarteriole is not continuous but forms rings of
smooth muscle (sphincters) prior to the entrance to the capillaries.
Each metarteriole arises from a terminal arteriole and branches to
supply blood to a <span data-type="term">capillary bed</span> that may
consist of 10–100 capillaries.
{: #fs-id2049014}

The <span data-type="term">precapillary sphincters</span>, circular
smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the
metarteriole, tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to
the capillaries it supplies. Their function is critical: If all of the
capillary beds in the body were to open simultaneously, they would
collectively hold every drop of blood in the body and there would be
none in the arteries, arterioles, venules, veins, or the heart itself.
Normally, the precapillary sphincters are closed. When the surrounding
tissues need oxygen and have excess waste products, the precapillary
sphincters open, allowing blood to flow through and exchange to occur
before closing once more ([\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_05){:
.autogenerated-content}). If all of the precapillary sphincters in a
capillary bed are closed, blood will flow from the metarteriole directly
into a <span data-type="term">thoroughfare channel</span> and then into
the venous circulation, bypassing the capillary bed entirely. This
creates what is known as a <span data-type="term">vascular shunt</span>.
In addition, an <span data-type="term">arteriovenous anastomosis</span>
may bypass the capillary bed and lead directly to the venous system.
{: #fs-id2137210}

Although you might expect blood flow through a capillary bed to be
smooth, in reality, it moves with an irregular, pulsating flow. This
pattern is called <span data-type="term">vasomotion</span> and is
regulated by chemical signals that are triggered in response to changes
in internal conditions, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion,
and lactic acid levels. For example, during strenuous exercise when
oxygen levels decrease and carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion, and lactic acid
levels all increase, the capillary beds in skeletal muscle are open, as
they would be in the digestive system when nutrients are present in the
digestive tract. During sleep or rest periods, vessels in both areas are
largely closed; they open only occasionally to allow oxygen and nutrient
supplies to travel to the tissues to maintain basic life processes.

# Venules
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">venule</span> is an extremely small vein,
generally 8–100 micrometers in diameter. Postcapillary venules join
multiple capillaries exiting from a capillary bed. Multiple venules join
to form veins. The walls of venules consist of endothelium, a thin
middle layer with a few muscle cells and elastic fibers, plus an outer
layer of connective tissue fibers that constitute a very thin tunica
externa ([\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_06){: .autogenerated-content}). Venules
as well as capillaries are the primary sites of emigration or

lining of the vessels and then squeeze through adjacent cells to enter

# Veins
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">vein</span> is a blood vessel that conducts
blood toward the heart. Compared to arteries, veins are thin-walled
vessels with large and irregular lumens (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_06){: .autogenerated-content}). Because they are
low-pressure vessels, larger veins are commonly equipped with valves
that promote the unidirectional flow of blood toward the heart and
prevent backflow toward the capillaries caused by the inherent low blood
pressure in veins as well as the pull of gravity.
[\[link\]](#tbl-ch21_02){: .autogenerated-content} compares the features
of arteries and veins.

</div>
<span data-type="title">Cardiovascular System: Edema and Varicose
Veins</span> Despite the presence of valves and the contributions of
other anatomical and physiological adaptations we will cover shortly,
over the course of a day, some blood will inevitably pool, especially in
the lower limbs, due to the pull of gravity. Any blood that accumulates
in a vein will increase the pressure within it, which can then be
reflected back into the smaller veins, venules, and eventually even the
capillaries. Increased pressure will promote the flow of fluids out of
the capillaries and into the interstitial fluid. The presence of excess
tissue fluid around the cells leads to a condition called edema.
{: #fs-id1429582}

Most people experience a daily accumulation of tissue fluid, especially
if they spend much of their work life on their feet (like most health
professionals). However, clinical edema goes beyond normal swelling and
requires medical treatment. Edema has many potential causes, including
hypertension and heart failure, severe protein deficiency, renal
failure, and many others. In order to treat edema, which is a sign
rather than a discrete disorder, the underlying cause must be diagnosed
and alleviated.

</figure>
Edema may be accompanied by varicose veins, especially in the
superficial veins of the legs ([\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_07){:
.autogenerated-content}). This disorder arises when defective valves
allow blood to accumulate within the veins, causing them to distend,
twist, and become visible on the surface of the integument. Varicose
veins may occur in both sexes, but are more common in women and are
often related to pregnancy. More than simple cosmetic blemishes,
varicose veins are often painful and sometimes itchy or throbbing.
Without treatment, they tend to grow worse over time. The use of support
hose, as well as elevating the feet and legs whenever possible, may be
helpful in alleviating this condition. Laser surgery and interventional
radiologic procedures can reduce the size and severity of varicose
veins. Severe cases may require conventional surgery to remove the
damaged vessels. As there are typically redundant circulation patterns,
that is, anastomoses, for the smaller and more superficial veins,
removal does not typically impair the circulation. There is evidence
that patients with varicose veins suffer a greater risk of developing a
thrombus or clot.

# Veins as Blood Reservoirs
{: data-type="title"}

In addition to their primary function of returning blood to the heart,
veins may be considered blood reservoirs, since systemic veins contain
approximately 64 percent of the blood volume at any given time
([\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_08){: .autogenerated-content}). Their ability
to hold this much blood is due to their high <span
data-type="term">capacitance</span>, that is, their capacity to distend
(expand) readily to store a high volume of blood, even at a low
pressure. The large lumens and relatively thin walls of veins make them
far more distensible than arteries; thus, they are said to be <span
data-type="term">capacitance vessels</span>.

</figure>
When blood flow needs to be redistributed to other portions of the body,
the vasomotor center located in the medulla oblongata sends sympathetic
stimulation to the smooth muscles in the walls of the veins, causing
constriction—or in this case, venoconstriction. Less dramatic than the
vasoconstriction seen in smaller arteries and arterioles,
venoconstriction may be likened to a “stiffening” of the vessel wall.
This increases pressure on the blood within the veins, speeding its
return to the heart. As you will note in [\[link\]](#fig-ch21_01_08){:
.autogenerated-content}, approximately 21 percent of the venous blood is
located in venous networks within the liver, bone marrow, and
integument. This volume of blood is referred to as <span
data-type="term">venous reserve</span>. Through venoconstriction, this
“reserve” volume of blood can get back to the heart more quickly for
redistribution to other parts of the circulation.

Career Connection
</div>
<span data-type="title">Vascular Surgeons and Technicians</span>
Vascular surgery is a specialty in which the physician deals primarily
with diseases of the vascular portion of the cardiovascular system. This
includes repair and replacement of diseased or damaged vessels, removal
of plaque from vessels, minimally invasive procedures including the
insertion of venous catheters, and traditional surgery. Following
completion of medical school, the physician generally completes a 5-year
surgical residency followed by an additional 1 to 2 years of vascular
specialty training. In the United States, most vascular surgeons are
members of the Society of Vascular Surgery.
{: #fs-id3001510}

Vascular technicians are specialists in imaging technologies that
provide information on the health of the vascular system. They may also
assist physicians in treating disorders involving the arteries and
veins. This profession often overlaps with cardiovascular technology,
which would also include treatments involving the heart. Although
recognized by the American Medical Association, there are currently no
licensing requirements for vascular technicians, and licensing is
voluntary. Vascular technicians typically have an Associate’s degree or
certificate, involving 18 months to 2 years of training. The United
States Bureau of Labor projects this profession to grow by 29 percent
from 2010 to 2020.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as
arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning
to the heart. Arteries transport blood away from the heart and branch
into smaller vessels, forming arterioles. Arterioles distribute blood to
capillary beds, the sites of exchange with the body tissues. Capillaries
lead back to small vessels known as venules that flow into the larger
veins and eventually back to the heart.
{: #fs-id2162303}

The arterial system is a relatively high-pressure system, so arteries
have thick walls that appear round in cross section. The venous system
is a lower-pressure system, containing veins that have larger lumens and
thinner walls. They often appear flattened. Arteries, arterioles,
venules, and veins are composed of three tunics known as the tunica
intima, tunica media, and tunica externa. Capillaries have only a tunica
intima layer. The tunica intima is a thin layer composed of a simple
squamous epithelium known as endothelium and a small amount of
connective tissue. The tunica media is a thicker area composed of
variable amounts of smooth muscle and connective tissue. It is the
thickest layer in all but the largest arteries. The tunica externa is
primarily a layer of connective tissue, although in veins, it also
contains some smooth muscle. Blood flow through vessels can be
dramatically influenced by vasoconstriction and vasodilation in their
walls.

Arterioles receive blood from arteries, which are vessels with a much
larger lumen. As their own lumen averages just 30 micrometers or less,
arterioles are critical in slowing down—or resisting—blood flow. The
arterioles can also constrict or dilate, which varies their resistance,
to help distribute blood flow to the tissues.
