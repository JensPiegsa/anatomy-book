<div data-type="abstract">
Human Anatomy and Physiology is designed for the two-semester anatomy and physiology course taken by life science and allied health students. The textbook follows the scope and sequence of most Human Anatomy and Physiology courses, and its coverage and organization were informed by hundreds of instructors who teach the course. Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom. The artwork for this textbook is aimed focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations. Color is used sparingly, to emphasize the most important aspects of any given illustration. Significant use of micrographs from the University of Michigan complement the illustrations, and provide the students with a meaningful alternate depiction of each concept. Finally, enrichment elements provide relevance and deeper context for students, particularly in the areas of health, disease, and information relevant to their intended careers.

# About *Anatomy and Physiology*   {#eip-394}

*Anatomy and Physiology* is designed for the two-semester anatomy and physiology course taken by life science and allied health students. It supports effective teaching and learning, and prepares students for further learning and future careers. The text focuses on the most important concepts and aims to minimize distracting students with more minor details.

The development choices for this textbook were made with the guidance of hundreds of faculty who are deeply involved in teaching this course. These choices led to innovations in art, terminology, career orientation, practical applications, and multimedia-based learning, all with a goal of increasing relevance to students. We strove to make the discipline meaningful and memorable to students, so that they can draw from it a working knowledge that will enrich their future studies.

## Coverage and Scope   {#eip-29}

The units of our *Anatomy and Physiology* textbook adhere to the scope and sequence followed by most two-semester courses nationwide.

### Unit 1: Levels of Organization    {#eip-217}

Chapters 1–4 provide students with a basic understanding of human anatomy and physiology, including its language, the levels of organization, and the basics of chemistry and cell biology. These chapters provide a foundation for the further study of the body. They also focus particularly on how the body’s regions, important chemicals, and cells maintain homeostasis.* * *

## Pedagogical Foundation and Features   {#eip-450}

*Anatomy and Physiology* is designed to promote scientific literacy. Throughout the text, you will find features that engage the students by taking selected topics a step further.

* **Homeostatic Imbalances** discusses the effects and results of imbalances in the body.
* **Disorders** showcases a disorder that is relevant to the body system at hand. This feature may focus on a specific disorder, or a set of related disorders.
* **Diseases** showcases a disease that is relevant to the body system at hand.
* **Aging** explores the effect aging has on a body’s system and specific disorders that manifest over time.
* **Career Connections** presents information on the various careers often pursued by allied health students, such as medical technician, medical examiner, and neurophysiologist. Students are introduced to the educational requirements for and day-to-day responsibilities in these careers.
* **Everyday Connections** tie anatomical and physiological concepts to emerging issues and discuss these in terms of everyday life. Topics include “Anabolic Steroids” and “The Effect of Second-Hand Tobacco Smoke.”
* **Interactive Links** direct students to online exercises, simulations, animations, and videos to add a fuller context to core content and help improve understanding of the material. Many features include links to the University of Michigan’s interactive WebScopes, which allow students to zoom in on micrographs in the collection. These resources were vetted by reviewers and other subject matter experts to ensure that they are effective and accurate. We strongly urge students to explore these links, whether viewing a video or inputting data into a simulation, to gain the fullest experience and to learn how to search for information independently.

## Dynamic, Learner-Centered Art   {#eip-72}

Our unique approach to visuals is designed to emphasize only the components most important in any given illustration. The art style is particularly aimed at focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations.

Much of the art in this book consists of black line illustrations. The strongest line is used to highlight the most important structures, and shading is used to show dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarify the primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration. This technique is intended to draw students’ attention to the critical learning point in the illustration, without distraction from excessive gradients, shadows, and highlights. Full color is used when the structure or process requires it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations). ![A color illustration of the pharynx.](../resources/Preface.png "By highlighting the most important portions of the illustration, the artwork helps students focus on the most important points, without overwhelming them.  "){: #eip-id1169396666468 data-title="The Pharynx"}



### Micrographs   {#eip-817}

Micrograph magnifications have been calculated based on the objective provided with the image. If a micrograph was recorded at 40×, and the image was magnified an additional 2×, we calculated the final magnification of the micrograph to be 80×.

Please note that, when viewing the textbook electronically, the micrograph magnification provided in the text does not take into account the size and magnification of the screen on your electronic device. There may be some variation. ![A color illustration of the pharynx.](../resources/Preface2.png "These glands secrete oils that lubricate and protect the skin. LM &#xD7; 400. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School &#xA9; 2012)"){: #eip-id1164925497177 data-title="Sebaceous Glands"}



### Learning Resources   {#eip-921}

The following resources are (or will be) available in addition to main text:

* PowerPoint slides: For each chapter, the illustrations are presented, one per slide, with their respective captions.
* Pronunciation guide: A subset of the text’s key terms are presented with easy-to-follow phonetic transcriptions. For example, blastocyst is rendered as “blas\'to-sist”
