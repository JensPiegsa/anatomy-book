The word intestine is derived from a Latin root meaning “internal,” and
indeed, the two organs together nearly fill the interior of the
abdominal cavity. In addition, called the small and large bowel, or
colloquially the “guts,” they constitute the greatest mass and length of
the alimentary canal and, with the exception of ingestion, perform all
digestive system functions.

# The Small Intestine
{: data-type="title"}

Chyme released from the stomach enters the <span data-type="term">small
intestine</span>, which is the primary digestive organ in the body. Not
only is this where most digestion occurs, it is also where practically
all absorption occurs. The longest part of the alimentary canal, the
small intestine is about 3.05 meters (10 feet) long in a living person
(but about twice as long in a cadaver due to the loss of muscle tone).
Since this makes it about five times longer than the large intestine,
you might wonder why it is called “small.” In fact, its name derives
from its relatively smaller diameter of only about 2.54 cm (1 in),
compared with 7.62 cm (3 in) for the large intestine. As we’ll see
shortly, in addition to its length, the folds and projections of the
lining of the small intestine work to give it an enormous surface area,
which is approximately 200 m<sup>2</sup>, more than 100 times the
surface area of your skin. This large surface area is necessary for
complex processes of digestion and absorption that occur within it.

## Structure
{: data-type="title"}

The coiled tube of the small intestine is subdivided into three regions.
From proximal (at the stomach) to distal, these are the duodenum,
jejunum, and ileum ([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_05_01){:
.autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id2142277}

The shortest region is the 25.4-cm (10-in) <span
data-type="term">duodenum</span>, which begins at the pyloric sphincter.
Just past the pyloric sphincter, it bends posteriorly behind the
peritoneum, becoming retroperitoneal, and then makes a C-shaped curve
around the head of the pancreas before ascending anteriorly again to
return to the peritoneal cavity and join the jejunum. The duodenum can
therefore be subdivided into four segments: the superior, descending,
horizontal, and ascending duodenum.
{: #fs-id2271264}

Of particular interest is the <span data-type="term">hepatopancreatic
ampulla</span> (ampulla of Vater). Located in the duodenal wall, the
ampulla marks the transition from the anterior portion of the alimentary
canal to the mid-region, and is where the bile duct (through which bile
passes from the liver) and the <span data-type="term">main pancreatic
duct</span> (through which pancreatic juice passes from the pancreas)
join. This ampulla opens into the duodenum at a tiny volcano-shaped
structure called the <span data-type="term">major duodenal
papilla</span>. The <span data-type="term">hepatopancreatic
sphincter</span> (sphincter of Oddi) regulates the flow of both bile and
pancreatic juice from the ampulla into the duodenum.

</figure>
The <span data-type="term">jejunum</span> is about 0.9 meters (3 feet)
long (in life) and runs from the duodenum to the ileum. Jejunum means
“empty” in Latin and supposedly was so named by the ancient Greeks who
noticed it was always empty at death. No clear demarcation exists
between the jejunum and the final segment of the small intestine, the
ileum.
{: #fs-id2311182}

The <span data-type="term">ileum</span> is the longest part of the small
intestine, measuring about 1.8 meters (6 feet) in length. It is thicker,
more vascular, and has more developed mucosal folds than the jejunum.
The ileum joins the cecum, the first portion of the large intestine, at
the <span data-type="term">ileocecal sphincter</span> (or valve). The
jejunum and ileum are tethered to the posterior abdominal wall by the
mesentery. The large intestine frames these three parts of the small
intestine.
{: #fs-id1921294}

Parasympathetic nerve fibers from the vagus nerve and sympathetic nerve
fibers from the thoracic splanchnic nerve provide extrinsic innervation
to the small intestine. The superior mesenteric artery is its main
arterial supply. Veins run parallel to the arteries and drain into the
superior mesenteric vein. Nutrient-rich blood from the small intestine
is then carried to the liver via the hepatic portal vein.

## Histology
{: data-type="title"}

The wall of the small intestine is composed of the same four layers
typically present in the alimentary system. However, three features of
the mucosa and submucosa are unique. These features, which increase the
absorptive surface area of the small intestine more than 600-fold,
include circular folds, villi, and microvilli
([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_05_02){: .autogenerated-content}). These
adaptations are most abundant in the proximal two-thirds of the small
intestine, where the majority of absorption occurs.

### Circular folds
{: data-type="title"}

Also called a plica circulare, a <span data-type="term">circular
fold</span> is a deep ridge in the mucosa and submucosa. Beginning near
the proximal part of the duodenum and ending near the middle of the
ileum, these folds facilitate absorption. Their shape causes the chyme
to spiral, rather than move in a straight line, through the small
intestine. Spiraling slows the movement of chyme and provides the time
needed for nutrients to be fully absorbed.
{: #fs-id1377788}

</section>
<section data-depth="3" id="fs-id2071232" markdown="1">
### Villi
{: data-type="title"}

Within the circular folds are small (0.5–1 mm long) hairlike
vascularized projections called <span data-type="term">villi</span>
(singular = villus) that give the mucosa a furry texture. There are
about 20 to 40 villi per square millimeter, increasing the surface area
of the epithelium tremendously. The mucosal epithelium, primarily
composed of absorptive cells, covers the villi. In addition to muscle
and connective tissue to support its structure, each villus contains a
capillary bed composed of one arteriole and one venule, as well as a
lymphatic capillary called a <span data-type="term">lacteal</span>. The
breakdown products of carbohydrates and proteins (sugars and amino
acids) can enter the bloodstream directly, but lipid breakdown products
are absorbed by the lacteals and transported to the bloodstream via the
lymphatic system.
{: #fs-id1272744}

</section>
<section data-depth="3" id="fs-id1976578" markdown="1">
### Microvilli
{: data-type="title"}

As their name suggests, <span data-type="term">microvilli</span>
(singular = microvillus) are much smaller (1 *µ*{:
data-effect="italics"}m) than villi. They are cylindrical apical surface
extensions of the plasma membrane of the mucosa’s epithelial cells, and
are supported by microfilaments within those cells. Although their small
size makes it difficult to see each microvillus, their combined
microscopic appearance suggests a mass of bristles, which is termed the
<span data-type="term">brush border</span>. Fixed to the surface of the
microvilli membranes are enzymes that finish digesting carbohydrates and
proteins. There are an estimated 200 million microvilli per square
millimeter of small intestine, greatly expanding the surface area of the
plasma membrane and thus greatly enhancing absorption.

<section data-depth="3" id="fs-id1582016" markdown="1">
### Intestinal Glands
{: data-type="title"}

In addition to the three specialized absorptive features just discussed,
the mucosa between the villi is dotted with deep crevices that each lead
into a tubular <span data-type="term">intestinal gland</span> (crypt of
Lieberkühn), which is formed by cells that line the crevices (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch24_05_02){: .autogenerated-content}). These produce
<span data-type="term">intestinal juice</span>, a slightly alkaline (pH
7.4 to 7.8) mixture of water and mucus. Each day, about 0.95 to 1.9
liters (1 to 2 quarts) are secreted in response to the distention of the
small intestine or the irritating effects of chyme on the intestinal
mucosa.
{: #fs-id1644865}

The submucosa of the duodenum is the only site of the complex
mucus-secreting <span data-type="term">duodenal glands</span> (Brunner’s
glands), which produce a bicarbonate-rich alkaline mucus that buffers
the acidic chyme as it enters from the stomach.
{: #fs-id2041977}

The roles of the cells in the small intestinal mucosa are detailed in

### Intestinal MALT
{: data-type="title"}

The lamina propria of the small intestine mucosa is studded with quite a
bit of MALT. In addition to solitary lymphatic nodules, aggregations of
intestinal MALT, which are typically referred to as Peyer’s patches, are
concentrated in the distal ileum, and serve to keep bacteria from
entering the bloodstream. Peyer’s patches are most prominent in young
people and become less distinct as you age, which coincides with the
general activity of our immune system.

## Mechanical Digestion in the Small Intestine
{: data-type="title"}

The movement of intestinal smooth muscles includes both segmentation and
a form of peristalsis called migrating motility complexes. The kind of
peristaltic mixing waves seen in the stomach are not observed here.
{: #fs-id1489768}

If you could see into the small intestine when it was going through
segmentation, it would look as if the contents were being shoved
incrementally back and forth, as the rings of smooth muscle repeatedly
contract and then relax. Segmentation in the small intestine does not
force chyme through the tract. Instead, it combines the chyme with
digestive juices and pushes food particles against the mucosa to be
absorbed. The duodenum is where the most rapid segmentation occurs, at a
rate of about 12 times per minute. In the ileum, segmentations are only
about eight times per minute ([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_05_03){:
.autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1837941}

<figure id="fig-ch24_05_03">
<div data-type="title">
Segmentation

<figcaption>
Segmentation separates chyme and then pushes it back together, mixing it
and providing time for digestion and absorption.

data-media-type="image/jpg" width="250"} </span>
</figure>
When most of the chyme has been absorbed, the small intestinal wall
becomes less distended. At this point, the localized segmentation
process is replaced by transport movements. The duodenal mucosa secretes
the hormone <span data-type="term">motilin</span>, which initiates
peristalsis in the form of a <span data-type="term">migrating motility
complex</span>. These complexes, which begin in the duodenum, force
chyme through a short section of the small intestine and then stop. The
next contraction begins a little bit farther down than the first, forces
chyme a bit farther through the small intestine, then stops. These
complexes move slowly down the small intestine, forcing chyme on the
way, taking around 90 to 120 minutes to finally reach the end of the
ileum. At this point, the process is repeated, starting in the duodenum.
{: #fs-id1866111}

The ileocecal valve, a sphincter, is usually in a constricted state, but
when motility in the ileum increases, this sphincter relaxes, allowing
food residue to enter the first portion of the large intestine, the
cecum. Relaxation of the ileocecal sphincter is controlled by both
nerves and hormones. First, digestive activity in the stomach provokes
the <span data-type="term">gastroileal reflex</span>, which increases
the force of ileal segmentation. Second, the stomach releases the
hormone gastrin, which enhances ileal motility, thus relaxing the
ileocecal sphincter. After chyme passes through, backward pressure helps
close the sphincter, preventing backflow into the ileum. Because of this
reflex, your lunch is completely emptied from your stomach and small
intestine by the time you eat your dinner. It takes about 3 to 5 hours
for all chyme to leave the small intestine.
{: #fs-id1764904}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2266816" markdown="1">
## Chemical Digestion in the Small Intestine
{: data-type="title"}

The digestion of proteins and carbohydrates, which partially occurs in
the stomach, is completed in the small intestine with the aid of
intestinal and pancreatic juices. Lipids arrive in the intestine largely
undigested, so much of the focus here is on lipid digestion, which is
facilitated by bile and the enzyme pancreatic lipase.
{: #fs-id1917388}

Moreover, intestinal juice combines with pancreatic juice to provide a
liquid medium that facilitates absorption. The intestine is also where
most water is absorbed, via osmosis. The small intestine’s absorptive
cells also synthesize digestive enzymes and then place them in the
plasma membranes of the microvilli. This distinguishes the small
intestine from the stomach; that is, enzymatic digestion occurs not only
in the lumen, but also on the luminal surfaces of the mucosal cells.
{: #fs-id2052631}

For optimal chemical digestion, chyme must be delivered from the stomach
slowly and in small amounts. This is because chyme from the stomach is
typically hypertonic, and if large quantities were forced all at once
into the small intestine, the resulting osmotic water loss from the
blood into the intestinal lumen would result in potentially
life-threatening low blood volume. In addition, continued digestion
requires an upward adjustment of the low pH of stomach chyme, along with
rigorous mixing of the chyme with bile and pancreatic juices. Both
processes take time, so the pumping action of the pylorus must be
carefully controlled to prevent the duodenum from being overwhelmed with
chyme.

Disorders of the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Small Intestine: Lactose Intolerance</span>
Lactose intolerance is a condition characterized by indigestion caused
by dairy products. It occurs when the absorptive cells of the small
intestine do not produce enough lactase, the enzyme that digests the
milk sugar lactose. In most mammals, lactose intolerance increases with
age. In contrast, some human populations, most notably Caucasians, are
able to maintain the ability to produce lactase as adults.
{: #fs-id1632981}

In people with lactose intolerance, the lactose in chyme is not
digested. Bacteria in the large intestine ferment the undigested
lactose, a process that produces gas. In addition to gas, symptoms
include abdominal cramps, bloating, and diarrhea. Symptom severity
ranges from mild discomfort to severe pain; however, symptoms resolve
once the lactose is eliminated in feces.
{: #fs-id1485386}

The hydrogen breath test is used to help diagnose lactose intolerance.
Lactose-tolerant people have very little hydrogen in their breath. Those
with lactose intolerance exhale hydrogen, which is one of the gases
produced by the bacterial fermentation of lactose in the colon. After
the hydrogen is absorbed from the intestine, it is transported through
blood vessels into the lungs. There are a number of lactose-free dairy
products available in grocery stores. In addition, dietary supplements
are available. Taken with food, they provide lactase to help digest
lactose.

# The Large Intestine
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">large intestine</span> is the terminal part
of the alimentary canal. The primary function of this organ is to finish
absorption of nutrients and water, synthesize certain vitamins, form
feces, and eliminate feces from the body.
{: #fs-id1896847}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1434975" markdown="1">
## Structure
{: data-type="title"}

The large intestine runs from the appendix to the anus. It frames the
small intestine on three sides. Despite its being about one-half as long
as the small intestine, it is called large because it is more than twice
the diameter of the small intestine, about 3 inches.
{: #fs-id1850868}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1290846" markdown="1">
## Subdivisions
{: data-type="title"}

The large intestine is subdivided into four main regions: the cecum, the
colon, the rectum, and the anus. The ileocecal valve, located at the
opening between the ileum and the large intestine, controls the flow of
chyme from the small intestine to the large intestine.
{: #fs-id1422467}

<section data-depth="3" id="fs-id1858888" markdown="1">
### Cecum
{: data-type="title"}

The first part of the large intestine is the <span
data-type="term">cecum</span>, a sac-like structure that is suspended
inferior to the ileocecal valve. It is about 6 cm (2.4 in) long,
receives the contents of the ileum, and continues the absorption of
water and salts. The <span data-type="term">appendix</span> (or
vermiform appendix) is a winding tube that attaches to the cecum.
Although the 7.6-cm (3-in) long appendix contains lymphoid tissue,
suggesting an immunologic function, this organ is generally considered
vestigial. However, at least one recent report postulates a survival
advantage conferred by the appendix: In diarrheal illness, the appendix
may serve as a bacterial reservoir to repopulate the enteric bacteria
for those surviving the initial phases of the illness. Moreover, its
twisted anatomy provides a haven for the accumulation and multiplication
of enteric bacteria. The <span data-type="term">mesoappendix</span>, the
mesentery of the appendix, tethers it to the mesentery of the ileum.

<section data-depth="3" id="fs-id1895143" markdown="1">
### Colon
{: data-type="title"}

The cecum blends seamlessly with the <span
data-type="term">colon</span>. Upon entering the colon, the food residue
first travels up the <span data-type="term">ascending colon</span> on
the right side of the abdomen. At the inferior surface of the liver, the
colon bends to form the <span data-type="term">right colic
flexure</span> (hepatic flexure) and becomes the <span
data-type="term">transverse colon</span>. The region defined as hindgut
begins with the last third of the transverse colon and continues on.
Food residue passing through the transverse colon travels across to the
left side of the abdomen, where the colon angles sharply immediately
inferior to the spleen, at the <span data-type="term">left colic
flexure</span> (splenic flexure). From there, food residue passes
through the <span data-type="term">descending colon</span>, which runs
down the left side of the posterior abdominal wall. After entering the
pelvis inferiorly, it becomes the s-shaped <span
data-type="term">sigmoid colon</span>, which extends medially to the
midline ([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_05_04){: .autogenerated-content}). The
ascending and descending colon, and the rectum (discussed next) are
located in the retroperitoneum. The transverse and sigmoid colon are
tethered to the posterior abdominal wall by the mesocolon.

<span data-type="title">Colorectal Cancer</span> Each year,
approximately 140,000 Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer,
and another 49,000 die from it, making it one of the most deadly
malignancies. People with a family history of colorectal cancer are at
increased risk. Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and a diet high
in animal fat and protein also increase the risk. Despite popular
opinion to the contrary, studies support the conclusion that dietary
fiber and calcium do not reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.
{: #fs-id1492813}

Colorectal cancer may be signaled by constipation or diarrhea, cramping,
abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding. Bleeding from the rectum may be
either obvious or occult (hidden in feces). Since most colon cancers
arise from benign mucosal growths called polyps, cancer prevention is
focused on identifying these polyps. The colonoscopy is both diagnostic
and therapeutic. Colonoscopy not only allows identification of
precancerous polyps, the procedure also enables them to be removed
before they become malignant. Screening for fecal occult blood tests and
colonoscopy is recommended for those over 50 years of age.

vertebra. The final 20.3 cm (8 in) of the alimentary canal, the rectum
extends anterior to the sacrum and coccyx. Even though rectum is Latin
for “straight,” this structure follows the curved contour of the sacrum
and has three lateral bends that create a trio of internal transverse
folds called the <span data-type="term">rectal valves</span>. These
valves help separate the feces from gas to prevent the simultaneous
passage of feces and gas.

perineum, completely outside of the abdominopelvic cavity. This 3.8–5 cm
(1.5–2 in) long structure opens to the exterior of the body at the anus.
The anal canal includes two sphincters. The <span

There are several notable differences between the walls of the large and
small intestines ([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_05_05){:
.autogenerated-content}). For example, few enzyme-secreting cells are
found in the wall of the large intestine, and there are no circular
folds or villi. Other than in the anal canal, the mucosa of the colon is
simple columnar epithelium made mostly of enterocytes (absorptive cells)
and goblet cells. In addition, the wall of the large intestine has far
more intestinal glands, which contain a vast population of enterocytes
and goblet cells. These goblet cells secrete mucus that eases the
movement of feces and protects the intestine from the effects of the
acids and gases produced by enteric bacteria. The enterocytes absorb
water and salts as well as vitamins produced by your intestinal
bacteria.

## Anatomy
{: data-type="title"}

Three features are unique to the large intestine: teniae coli, haustra,
and epiploic appendages ([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_05_06){:
.autogenerated-content}). The <span data-type="term">teniae coli</span>
are three bands of smooth muscle that make up the longitudinal muscle
layer of the muscularis of the large intestine, except at its terminal
end. Tonic contractions of the teniae coli bunch up the colon into a
succession of pouches called <span data-type="term">haustra</span>
(singular = hostrum), which are responsible for the wrinkled appearance
of the colon. Attached to the teniae coli are small, fat-filled sacs of
visceral peritoneum called <span data-type="term">epiploic
appendages</span>. The purpose of these is unknown. Although the rectum
and anal canal have neither teniae coli nor haustra, they do have
well-developed layers of muscularis that create the strong contractions
needed for defecation.

</figure>
The stratified squamous epithelial mucosa of the anal canal connects to
the skin on the outside of the anus. This mucosa varies considerably
from that of the rest of the colon to accommodate the high level of
abrasion as feces pass through. The anal canal’s mucous membrane is
organized into longitudinal folds, each called an <span
data-type="term">anal column</span>, which house a grid of arteries and
veins. Two superficial venous plexuses are found in the anal canal: one
within the anal columns and one at the anus.
{: #fs-id1224217}

Depressions between the anal columns, each called an <span
data-type="term">anal sinus</span>, secrete mucus that facilitates
defecation. The <span data-type="term">pectinate line</span> (or dentate
line) is a horizontal, jagged band that runs circumferentially just
below the level of the anal sinuses, and represents the junction between
the hindgut and external skin. The mucosa above this line is fairly
insensitive, whereas the area below is very sensitive. The resulting
difference in pain threshold is due to the fact that the upper region is
innervated by visceral sensory fibers, and the lower region is
innervated by somatic sensory fibers.

## Bacterial Flora
{: data-type="title"}

Most bacteria that enter the alimentary canal are killed by lysozyme,
defensins, HCl, or protein-digesting enzymes. However, trillions of
bacteria live within the large intestine and are referred to as the
<span data-type="term">bacterial flora</span>. Most of the more than 700
species of these bacteria are nonpathogenic commensal organisms that
cause no harm as long as they stay in the gut lumen. In fact, many
facilitate chemical digestion and absorption, and some synthesize
certain vitamins, mainly biotin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin K. Some
are linked to increased immune response. A refined system prevents these
bacteria from crossing the mucosal barrier. First, peptidoglycan, a
component of bacterial cell walls, activates the release of chemicals by
the mucosa’s epithelial cells, which draft immune cells, especially
dendritic cells, into the mucosa. Dendritic cells open the tight
junctions between epithelial cells and extend probes into the lumen to
evaluate the microbial antigens. The dendritic cells with antigens then
travel to neighboring lymphoid follicles in the mucosa where T cells
inspect for antigens. This process triggers an IgA-mediated response, if
warranted, in the lumen that blocks the commensal organisms from
infiltrating the mucosa and setting off a far greater, widespread
systematic reaction.

## Digestive Functions of the Large Intestine
{: data-type="title"}

The residue of chyme that enters the large intestine contains few
nutrients except water, which is reabsorbed as the residue lingers in
the large intestine, typically for 12 to 24 hours. Thus, it may not
surprise you that the large intestine can be completely removed without
significantly affecting digestive functioning. For example, in severe
cases of inflammatory bowel disease, the large intestine can be removed
by a procedure known as a colectomy. Often, a new fecal pouch can be
crafted from the small intestine and sutured to the anus, but if not, an
ileostomy can be created by bringing the distal ileum through the
abdominal wall, allowing the watery chyme to be collected in a bag-like
adhesive appliance.
{: #fs-id2144177}

<section data-depth="3" id="fs-id1690001" markdown="1">
### Mechanical Digestion
{: data-type="title"}

In the large intestine, mechanical digestion begins when chyme moves
from the ileum into the cecum, an activity regulated by the ileocecal
sphincter. Right after you eat, peristalsis in the ileum forces chyme
into the cecum. When the cecum is distended with chyme, contractions of
the ileocecal sphincter strengthen. Once chyme enters the cecum, colon
movements begin.
{: #fs-id1288531}

Mechanical digestion in the large intestine includes a combination of
three types of movements. The presence of food residues in the colon
stimulates a slow-moving <span data-type="term">haustral
contraction</span>. This type of movement involves sluggish
segmentation, primarily in the transverse and descending colons. When a
haustrum is distended with chyme, its muscle contracts, pushing the
residue into the next haustrum. These contractions occur about every 30
minutes, and each last about 1 minute. These movements also mix the food
residue, which helps the large intestine absorb water. The second type
of movement is peristalsis, which, in the large intestine, is slower
than in the more proximal portions of the alimentary canal. The third
type is a <span data-type="term">mass movement</span>. These strong
waves start midway through the transverse colon and quickly force the
contents toward the rectum. Mass movements usually occur three or four
times per day, either while you eat or immediately afterward. Distension
in the stomach and the breakdown products of digestion in the small
intestine provoke the <span data-type="term">gastrocolic reflex</span>,
which increases motility, including mass movements, in the colon. Fiber
in the diet both softens the stool and increases the power of colonic
contractions, optimizing the activities of the colon.

### Chemical Digestion
{: data-type="title"}

Although the glands of the large intestine secrete mucus, they do not
secrete digestive enzymes. Therefore, chemical digestion in the large
intestine occurs exclusively because of bacteria in the lumen of the
colon. Through the process of <span data-type="term">saccharolytic
fermentation</span>, bacteria break down some of the remaining
carbohydrates. This results in the discharge of hydrogen, carbon
dioxide, and methane gases that create <span
data-type="term">flatus</span> (gas) in the colon; flatulence is
excessive flatus. Each day, up to 1500 mL of flatus is produced in the
colon. More is produced when you eat foods such as beans, which are rich
in otherwise indigestible sugars and complex carbohydrates like soluble
dietary fiber.

## Absorption, Feces Formation, and Defecation
{: data-type="title"}

The small intestine absorbs about 90 percent of the water you ingest
(either as liquid or within solid food). The large intestine absorbs
most of the remaining water, a process that converts the liquid chyme
residue into semisolid <span data-type="term">feces</span> (“stool”).
Feces is composed of undigested food residues, unabsorbed digested
substances, millions of bacteria, old epithelial cells from the GI
mucosa, inorganic salts, and enough water to let it pass smoothly out of
the body. Of every 500 mL (17 ounces) of food residue that enters the
cecum each day, about 150 mL (5 ounces) become feces.
{: #fs-id810144}

Feces are eliminated through contractions of the rectal muscles. You
help this process by a voluntary procedure called <span
data-type="term">Valsalva’s maneuver</span>, in which you increase
intra-abdominal pressure by contracting your diaphragm and abdominal
wall muscles, and closing your glottis.
{: #fs-id1520875}

The process of defecation begins when mass movements force feces from
the colon into the rectum, stretching the rectal wall and provoking the
defecation reflex, which eliminates feces from the rectum. This
parasympathetic reflex is mediated by the spinal cord. It contracts the
sigmoid colon and rectum, relaxes the internal anal sphincter, and
initially contracts the external anal sphincter. The presence of feces
in the anal canal sends a signal to the brain, which gives you the
choice of voluntarily opening the external anal sphincter (defecating)
or keeping it temporarily closed. If you decide to delay defecation, it
takes a few seconds for the reflex contractions to stop and the rectal
walls to relax. The next mass movement will trigger additional
defecation reflexes until you defecate.
{: #fs-id1477402}

If defecation is delayed for an extended time, additional water is
absorbed, making the feces firmer and potentially leading to
constipation. On the other hand, if the waste matter moves too quickly
through the intestines, not enough water is absorbed, and diarrhea can
result. This can be caused by the ingestion of foodborne pathogens. In
general, diet, health, and stress determine the frequency of bowel
movements. The number of bowel movements varies greatly between
individuals, ranging from two or three per day to three or four per
week.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The three main regions of the small intestine are the duodenum, the
jejunum, and the ileum. The small intestine is where digestion is
completed and virtually all absorption occurs. These two activities are
facilitated by structural adaptations that increase the mucosal surface
area by 600-fold, including circular folds, villi, and microvilli. There
are around 200 million microvilli per square millimeter of small
intestine, which contain brush border enzymes that complete the
digestion of carbohydrates and proteins. Combined with pancreatic juice,
intestinal juice provides the liquid medium needed to further digest and
absorb substances from chyme. The small intestine is also the site of
unique mechanical digestive movements. Segmentation moves the chyme back
and forth, increasing mixing and opportunities for absorption. Migrating
motility complexes propel the residual chyme toward the large intestine.
{: #fs-id1391067}

The main regions of the large intestine are the cecum, the colon, and
the rectum. The large intestine absorbs water and forms feces, and is
responsible for defecation. Bacterial flora break down additional
carbohydrate residue, and synthesize certain vitamins. The mucosa of the
large intestinal wall is generously endowed with goblet cells, which
secrete mucus that eases the passage of feces. The entry of feces into
the rectum activates the defecation reflex.
