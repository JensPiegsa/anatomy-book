By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Name the major regions of the adult brain
* Describe the connections between the cerebrum and brain stem through
  the diencephalon, and from those regions into the spinal cord
* Recognize the complex connections within the subcortical structures of
  the basal nuclei
* Explain the arrangement of gray and white matter in the spinal cord

</div>
The brain and the spinal cord are the central nervous system, and they
represent the main organs of the nervous system. The spinal cord is a
single structure, whereas the adult brain is described in terms of four
major regions: the cerebrum, the diencephalon, the brain stem, and the
cerebellum. A person’s conscious experiences are based on neural
activity in the brain. The regulation of homeostasis is governed by a
specialized region in the brain. The coordination of reflexes depends on
the integration of sensory and motor pathways in the spinal cord.

# The Cerebrum
{: data-type="title"}

The iconic gray mantle of the human brain, which appears to make up most
of the mass of the brain, is the <span data-type="term">cerebrum</span>
([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_02_01){: .autogenerated-content}). The wrinkled
portion is the <span data-type="term">cerebral cortex</span>, and the
rest of the structure is beneath that outer covering. There is a large
separation between the two sides of the cerebrum called the <span
data-type="term">longitudinal fissure</span>. It separates the cerebrum
into two distinct halves, a right and left <span
data-type="term">cerebral hemisphere</span>. Deep within the cerebrum,
the white matter of the <span data-type="term">corpus callosum</span>
provides the major pathway for communication between the two hemispheres
of the cerebral cortex.

Many of the higher neurological functions, such as memory, emotion, and
consciousness, are the result of cerebral function. The complexity of
the cerebrum is different across vertebrate species. The cerebrum of the
most primitive vertebrates is not much more than the connection for the
sense of smell. In mammals, the cerebrum comprises the outer gray matter
that is the cortex (from the Latin word meaning “bark of a tree”) and
several deep nuclei that belong to three important functional groups.
The <span data-type="term">basal nuclei</span> are responsible for
cognitive processing, the most important function being that associated
with planning movements. The <span data-type="term">basal
forebrain</span> contains nuclei that are important in learning and
memory. The <span data-type="term">limbic cortex</span> is the region of
the cerebral cortex that is part of the <span data-type="term">limbic
system</span>, a collection of structures involved in emotion, memory,
and behavior.

## Cerebral Cortex
{: data-type="title"}

The cerebrum is covered by a continuous layer of gray matter that wraps
around either side of the forebrain—the cerebral cortex. This thin,
extensive region of wrinkled gray matter is responsible for the higher
functions of the nervous system. A <span data-type="term">gyrus</span>
(plural = gyri) is the ridge of one of those wrinkles, and a <span
data-type="term">sulcus</span> (plural = sulci) is the groove between
two gyri. The pattern of these folds of tissue indicates specific
regions of the cerebral cortex.
{: #fs-id1298164}

The head is limited by the size of the birth canal, and the brain must
fit inside the cranial cavity of the skull. Extensive folding in the
cerebral cortex enables more gray matter to fit into this limited space.
If the gray matter of the cortex were peeled off of the cerebrum and
laid out flat, its surface area would be roughly equal to one square
meter.
{: #fs-id1300741}

The folding of the cortex maximizes the amount of gray matter in the
cranial cavity. During embryonic development, as the telencephalon
expands within the skull, the brain goes through a regular course of
growth that results in everyone’s brain having a similar pattern of
folds. The surface of the brain can be mapped on the basis of the
locations of large gyri and sulci. Using these landmarks, the cortex can
be separated into four major regions, or lobes
([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_02_02){: .autogenerated-content}). The <span
data-type="term">lateral sulcus</span> that separates the <span
data-type="term">temporal lobe</span> from the other regions is one such
landmark. Superior to the lateral sulcus are the <span
data-type="term">parietal lobe</span> and <span data-type="term">frontal
lobe</span>, which are separated from each other by the <span
data-type="term">central sulcus</span>. The posterior region of the
cortex is the <span data-type="term">occipital lobe</span>, which has no
obvious anatomical border between it and the parietal or temporal lobes
on the lateral surface of the brain. From the medial surface, an obvious
landmark separating the parietal and occipital lobes is called the <span
data-type="term">parieto-occipital sulcus</span>. The fact that there is
no obvious anatomical border between these lobes is consistent with the
functions of these regions being interrelated.

</figure>
Different regions of the cerebral cortex can be associated with
particular functions, a concept known as localization of function. In
the early 1900s, a German neuroscientist named Korbinian Brodmann
performed an extensive study of the microscopic anatomy—the
cytoarchitecture—of the cerebral cortex and divided the cortex into 52
separate regions on the basis of the histology of the cortex. His work
resulted in a system of classification known as <span
data-type="term">Brodmann’s areas</span>, which is still used today to
describe the anatomical distinctions within the cortex
([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}). The results
from Brodmann’s work on the anatomy align very well with the functional
differences within the cortex. Areas 17 and 18 in the occipital lobe are
responsible for primary visual perception. That visual information is
complex, so it is processed in the temporal and parietal lobes as well.
{: #fs-id1163314}

The temporal lobe is associated with primary auditory sensation, known
as Brodmann’s areas 41 and 42 in the superior temporal lobe. Because
regions of the temporal lobe are part of the limbic system, memory is an
important function associated with that lobe. Memory is essentially a
sensory function; memories are recalled sensations such as the smell of
Mom’s baking or the sound of a barking dog. Even memories of movement
are really the memory of sensory feedback from those movements, such as
stretching muscles or the movement of the skin around a joint.
Structures in the temporal lobe are responsible for establishing
long-term memory, but the ultimate location of those memories is usually
in the region in which the sensory perception was processed.
{: #fs-id2055928}

The main sensation associated with the parietal lobe is <span
data-type="term">somatosensation</span>, meaning the general sensations
associated with the body. Posterior to the central sulcus is the <span
data-type="term">postcentral gyrus</span>, the primary somatosensory
cortex, which is identified as Brodmann’s areas 1, 2, and 3. All of the
tactile senses are processed in this area, including touch, pressure,
tickle, pain, itch, and vibration, as well as more general senses of the
body such as <span data-type="term">proprioception</span> and <span
data-type="term">kinesthesia</span>, which are the senses of body
position and movement, respectively.
{: #fs-id1319713}

Anterior to the central sulcus is the frontal lobe, which is primarily
associated with motor functions. The <span data-type="term">precentral
gyrus</span> is the primary motor cortex. Cells from this region of the
cerebral cortex are the upper motor neurons that instruct cells in the
spinal cord to move skeletal muscles. Anterior to this region are a few
areas that are associated with planned movements. The <span
data-type="term">premotor area</span> is responsible for thinking of a
movement to be made. The <span data-type="term">frontal eye
fields</span> are important in eliciting eye movements and in attending
to visual stimuli. <span data-type="term">Broca’s area</span> is
responsible for the production of language, or controlling movements
responsible for speech; in the vast majority of people, it is located
only on the left side. Anterior to these regions is the <span
data-type="term">prefrontal lobe</span>, which serves cognitive
functions that can be the basis of personality, short-term memory, and
consciousness. The prefrontal lobotomy is an outdated mode of treatment
for personality disorders (psychiatric conditions) that profoundly
affected the personality of the patient.

## Subcortical structures
{: data-type="title"}

Beneath the cerebral cortex are sets of nuclei known as <span
data-type="term">subcortical nuclei</span> that augment cortical
processes. The nuclei of the basal forebrain serve as the primary
location for acetylcholine production, which modulates the overall
activity of the cortex, possibly leading to greater attention to sensory
stimuli. Alzheimer’s disease is associated with a loss of neurons in the
basal forebrain. The <span data-type="term">hippocampus</span> and <span
data-type="term">amygdala</span> are medial-lobe structures that, along
with the adjacent cortex, are involved in long-term memory formation and
emotional responses. The basal nuclei are a set of nuclei in the
cerebrum responsible for comparing cortical processing with the general
state of activity in the nervous system to influence the likelihood of
movement taking place. For example, while a student is sitting in a
classroom listening to a lecture, the basal nuclei will keep the urge to
jump up and scream from actually happening. (The basal nuclei are also
referred to as the basal ganglia, although that is potentially confusing
because the term ganglia is typically used for peripheral structures.)
{: #fs-id793857}

The major structures of the basal nuclei that control movement are the
<span data-type="term">caudate</span>, <span
data-type="term">putamen</span>, and <span data-type="term">globus
pallidus</span>, which are located deep in the cerebrum. The caudate is
a long nucleus that follows the basic C-shape of the cerebrum from the
frontal lobe, through the parietal and occipital lobes, into the
temporal lobe. The putamen is mostly deep in the anterior regions of the
frontal and parietal lobes. Together, the caudate and putamen are called
the <span data-type="term">striatum</span>. The globus pallidus is a
layered nucleus that lies just medial to the putamen; they are called
the lenticular nuclei because they look like curved pieces fitting
together like lenses. The globus pallidus has two subdivisions, the
external and internal segments, which are lateral and medial,
respectively. These nuclei are depicted in a frontal section of the
brain in [\[link\]](#fig-ch13_02_04){: .autogenerated-content}.

</div>
<figcaption>
The major components of the basal nuclei, shown in a frontal section of
the brain, are the caudate (just lateral to the lateral ventricle), the
putamen (inferior to the caudate and separated by the large white-matter
structure called the internal capsule), and the globus pallidus (medial
to the putamen).

</figure>
The basal nuclei in the cerebrum are connected with a few more nuclei in
the brain stem that together act as a functional group that forms a
motor pathway. Two streams of information processing take place in the
basal nuclei. All input to the basal nuclei is from the cortex into the
striatum ([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_02_05){: .autogenerated-content}). The
<span data-type="term">direct pathway</span> is the projection of axons
from the striatum to the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) and the
<span data-type="term">substantia nigra pars reticulata</span> (SNr).
The GPi/SNr then projects to the thalamus, which projects back to the
cortex. The <span data-type="term">indirect pathway</span> is the
projection of axons from the striatum to the globus pallidus external
segment (GPe), then to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and finally to
GPi/SNr. The two streams both target the GPi/SNr, but one has a direct
projection and the other goes through a few intervening nuclei. The
direct pathway causes the <span data-type="term">disinhibition</span> of
the thalamus (inhibition of one cell on a target cell that then inhibits
the first cell), whereas the indirect pathway causes, or reinforces, the
normal inhibition of the thalamus. The thalamus then can either excite
the cortex (as a result of the direct pathway) or fail to excite the
cortex (as a result of the indirect pathway).
{: #fs-id1475986}

<figure id="fig-ch13_02_05">
<div data-type="title">
Connections of Basal Nuclei
</div>
<figcaption>
Input to the basal nuclei is from the cerebral cortex, which is an
excitatory connection releasing glutamate as a neurotransmitter. This
input is to the striatum, or the caudate and putamen. In the direct
pathway, the striatum projects to the internal segment of the globus
pallidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (GPi/SNr). This is an
inhibitory pathway, in which GABA is released at the synapse, and the
target cells are hyperpolarized and less likely to fire. The output from
the basal nuclei is to the thalamus, which is an inhibitory projection
using GABA.
</figcaption>
<span markdown="1" data-type="media" id="fs-id839392" data-alt="This flowchart shows
the connection between the different regions of the brain such as the
cortex, striatum and the thalamus."> ![This flowchart shows the

data-media-type="image/jpg" width="295"} </span>
</figure>
The switch between the two pathways is the <span
data-type="term">substantia nigra pars compacta</span>, which projects
to the striatum and releases the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine
receptors are either excitatory (D1-type receptors) or inhibitory
(D2-type receptors). The direct pathway is activated by dopamine, and
the indirect pathway is inhibited by dopamine. When the substantia nigra
pars compacta is firing, it signals to the basal nuclei that the body is
in an active state, and movement will be more likely. When the
substantia nigra pars compacta is silent, the body is in a passive
state, and movement is inhibited. To illustrate this situation, while a
student is sitting listening to a lecture, the substantia nigra pars
compacta would be silent and the student less likely to get up and walk
around. Likewise, while the professor is lecturing, and walking around
at the front of the classroom, the professor’s substantia nigra pars
compacta would be active, in keeping with his or her activity level.

Everyday Connections
</div>
<span data-type="title">The Myth of Left Brain/Right Brain</span> There
is a persistent myth that people are “right-brained” or “left-brained,”
which is an oversimplification of an important concept about the
cerebral hemispheres. There is some lateralization of function, in which
the left side of the brain is devoted to language function and the right
side is devoted to spatial and nonverbal reasoning. Whereas these
functions are predominantly associated with those sides of the brain,
there is no monopoly by either side on these functions. Many pervasive
functions, such as language, are distributed globally around the
cerebrum.
{: #fs-id1860230}

Some of the support for this misconception has come from studies of
split brains. A drastic way to deal with a rare and devastating
neurological condition (intractable epilepsy) is to separate the two
hemispheres of the brain. After sectioning the corpus callosum, a
split-brained patient will have trouble producing verbal responses on
the basis of sensory information processed on the right side of the
cerebrum, leading to the idea that the left side is responsible for
language function.
{: #fs-id1233440}

However, there are well-documented cases of language functions lost from
damage to the right side of the brain. The deficits seen in damage to
the left side of the brain are classified as aphasia, a loss of speech
function; damage on the right side can affect the use of language.
Right-side damage can result in a loss of ability to understand
figurative aspects of speech, such as jokes, irony, or metaphors.
Nonverbal aspects of speech can be affected by damage to the right side,
such as facial expression or body language, and right-side damage can
lead to a “flat affect” in speech, or a loss of emotional expression in
speech—sounding like a robot when talking.

# The Diencephalon
{: data-type="title"}

The diencephalon is the one region of the adult brain that retains its
name from embryologic development. The etymology of the word
diencephalon translates to “through brain.” It is the connection between
the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system, with one exception. The
rest of the brain, the spinal cord, and the PNS all send information to
the cerebrum through the diencephalon. Output from the cerebrum passes
through the diencephalon. The single exception is the system associated
with <span data-type="term">olfaction</span>, or the sense of smell,
which connects directly with the cerebrum. In the earliest vertebrate
species, the cerebrum was not much more than olfactory bulbs that
received peripheral information about the chemical environment (to call
it smell in these organisms is imprecise because they lived in the
ocean).
{: #fs-id1120163}

The diencephalon is deep beneath the cerebrum and constitutes the walls
of the third ventricle. The diencephalon can be described as any region
of the brain with “thalamus” in its name. The two major regions of the
diencephalon are the thalamus itself and the hypothalamus
([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_02_06){: .autogenerated-content}). There are other
structures, such as the <span data-type="term">epithalamus</span>, which
contains the pineal gland, or the <span
data-type="term">subthalamus</span>, which includes the subthalamic
nucleus that is part of the basal nuclei.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1196887" markdown="1">
## Thalamus
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">thalamus</span> is a collection of nuclei
that relay information between the cerebral cortex and the periphery,
spinal cord, or brain stem. All sensory information, except for the
sense of smell, passes through the thalamus before processing by the
cortex. Axons from the peripheral sensory organs, or intermediate
nuclei, synapse in the thalamus, and thalamic neurons project directly
to the cerebrum. It is a requisite synapse in any sensory pathway,
except for olfaction. The thalamus does not just pass the information
on, it also processes that information. For example, the portion of the
thalamus that receives visual information will influence what visual
stimuli are important, or what receives attention.
{: #fs-id1234023}

The cerebrum also sends information down to the thalamus, which usually
communicates motor commands. This involves interactions with the
cerebellum and other nuclei in the brain stem. The cerebrum interacts
with the basal nuclei, which involves connections with the thalamus. The
primary output of the basal nuclei is to the thalamus, which relays that
output to the cerebral cortex. The cortex also sends information to the
thalamus that will then influence the effects of the basal nuclei.

# Brain Stem
{: data-type="title"}

The midbrain and hindbrain (composed of the pons and the medulla) are
collectively referred to as the brain stem
([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_02_07){: .autogenerated-content}). The structure
emerges from the ventral surface of the forebrain as a tapering cone
that connects the brain to the spinal cord. Attached to the brain stem,
but considered a separate region of the adult brain, is the cerebellum.
The midbrain coordinates sensory representations of the visual,
auditory, and somatosensory perceptual spaces. The pons is the main
connection with the cerebellum. The pons and the medulla regulate
several crucial functions, including the cardiovascular and respiratory
systems and rates.
{: #fs-id1523364}

The cranial nerves connect through the brain stem and provide the brain
with the sensory input and motor output associated with the head and
neck, including most of the special senses. The major ascending and
descending pathways between the spinal cord and brain, specifically the
cerebrum, pass through the brain stem.

## Midbrain
{: data-type="title"}

One of the original regions of the embryonic brain, the midbrain is a
small region between the thalamus and pons. It is separated into the
<span data-type="term">tectum</span> and <span
data-type="term">tegmentum</span>, from the Latin words for roof and
floor, respectively. The cerebral aqueduct passes through the center of
the midbrain, such that these regions are the roof and floor of that
canal.
{: #fs-id890816}

The tectum is composed of four bumps known as the colliculi (singular =
colliculus), which means “little hill” in Latin. The <span
data-type="term">inferior colliculus</span> is the inferior pair of
these enlargements and is part of the auditory brain stem pathway.
Neurons of the inferior colliculus project to the thalamus, which then
sends auditory information to the cerebrum for the conscious perception
of sound. The <span data-type="term">superior colliculus</span> is the
superior pair and combines sensory information about visual space,
auditory space, and somatosensory space. Activity in the superior
colliculus is related to orienting the eyes to a sound or touch
stimulus. If you are walking along the sidewalk on campus and you hear
chirping, the superior colliculus coordinates that information with your
awareness of the visual location of the tree right above you. That is
the correlation of auditory and visual maps. If you suddenly feel
something wet fall on your head, your superior colliculus integrates
that with the auditory and visual maps and you know that the chirping
bird just relieved itself on you. You want to look up to see the
culprit, but do not.
{: #fs-id1282943}

The tegmentum is continuous with the gray matter of the rest of the
brain stem. Throughout the midbrain, pons, and medulla, the tegmentum
contains the nuclei that receive and send information through the
cranial nerves, as well as regions that regulate important functions
such as those of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

## Pons
{: data-type="title"}

The word pons comes from the Latin word for bridge. It is visible on the
anterior surface of the brain stem as the thick bundle of white matter
attached to the cerebellum. The pons is the main connection between the
cerebellum and the brain stem. The bridge-like white matter is only the
anterior surface of the pons; the gray matter beneath that is a
continuation of the tegmentum from the midbrain. Gray matter in the
tegmentum region of the pons contains neurons receiving descending input
from the forebrain that is sent to the cerebellum.

## Medulla
{: data-type="title"}

The medulla is the region known as the myelencephalon in the embryonic
brain. The initial portion of the name, “myel,” refers to the
significant white matter found in this region—especially on its
exterior, which is continuous with the white matter of the spinal cord.
The tegmentum of the midbrain and pons continues into the medulla
because this gray matter is responsible for processing cranial nerve
information. A diffuse region of gray matter throughout the brain stem,
known as the <span data-type="term">reticular formation</span>, is
related to sleep and wakefulness, such as general brain activity and
attention.

# The Cerebellum
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">cerebellum</span>, as the name suggests, is
the “little brain.” It is covered in gyri and sulci like the cerebrum,
and looks like a miniature version of that part of the brain
([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_02_08){: .autogenerated-content}). The cerebellum
is largely responsible for comparing information from the cerebrum with
sensory feedback from the periphery through the spinal cord. It accounts
for approximately 10 percent of the mass of the brain.

The cerebellum is situated on the posterior surface of the brain stem.

</figure>
Descending fibers from the cerebrum have branches that connect to
neurons in the pons. Those neurons project into the cerebellum,
providing a copy of motor commands sent to the spinal cord. Sensory
information from the periphery, which enters through spinal or cranial
nerves, is copied to a nucleus in the medulla known as the <span
data-type="term">inferior olive</span>. Fibers from this nucleus enter
the cerebellum and are compared with the descending commands from the
cerebrum. If the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe sends a
command down to the spinal cord to initiate walking, a copy of that
instruction is sent to the cerebellum. Sensory feedback from the muscles
and joints, proprioceptive information about the movements of walking,
and sensations of balance are sent to the cerebellum through the
inferior olive and the cerebellum compares them. If walking is not
coordinated, perhaps because the ground is uneven or a strong wind is
blowing, then the cerebellum sends out a corrective command to
compensate for the difference between the original cortical command and
the sensory feedback. The output of the cerebellum is into the midbrain,
which then sends a descending input to the spinal cord to correct the
messages going to skeletal muscles.

# The Spinal Cord
{: data-type="title"}

The description of the CNS is concentrated on the structures of the
brain, but the spinal cord is another major organ of the system. Whereas
the brain develops out of expansions of the neural tube into primary and
then secondary vesicles, the spinal cord maintains the tube structure
and is only specialized into certain regions. As the spinal cord
continues to develop in the newborn, anatomical features mark its
surface. The anterior midline is marked by the <span
data-type="term">anterior median fissure</span>, and the posterior
midline is marked by the <span data-type="term">posterior median
sulcus</span>. Axons enter the posterior side through the <span
data-type="term">dorsal (posterior) nerve root</span>, which marks the
<span data-type="term">posterolateral sulcus</span> on either side. The
axons emerging from the anterior side do so through the <span
data-type="term">ventral (anterior) nerve root</span>. Note that it is
common to see the terms dorsal (dorsal = “back”) and ventral (ventral =
“belly”) used interchangeably with posterior and anterior, particularly
in reference to nerves and the structures of the spinal cord. You should
learn to be comfortable with both.
{: #fs-id1523219}

On the whole, the posterior regions are responsible for sensory
functions and the anterior regions are associated with motor functions.
This comes from the initial development of the spinal cord, which is
divided into the <span data-type="term">basal plate</span> and the <span
data-type="term">alar plate</span>. The basal plate is closest to the
ventral midline of the neural tube, which will become the anterior face
of the spinal cord and gives rise to motor neurons. The alar plate is on
the dorsal side of the neural tube and gives rise to neurons that will
receive sensory input from the periphery.
{: #fs-id1128769}

The length of the spinal cord is divided into regions that correspond to
the regions of the vertebral column. The name of a spinal cord region
corresponds to the level at which spinal nerves pass through the
intervertebral foramina. Immediately adjacent to the brain stem is the
cervical region, followed by the thoracic, then the lumbar, and finally
the sacral region. The spinal cord is not the full length of the
vertebral column because the spinal cord does not grow significantly
longer after the first or second year, but the skeleton continues to
grow. The nerves that emerge from the spinal cord pass through the
intervertebral formina at the respective levels. As the vertebral column
grows, these nerves grow with it and result in a long bundle of nerves
that resembles a horse’s tail and is named the <span
data-type="term">cauda equina</span>. The sacral spinal cord is at the
level of the upper lumbar vertebral bones. The spinal nerves extend from
their various levels to the proper level of the vertebral column.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1153084" markdown="1">
## Gray Horns
{: data-type="title"}

In cross-section, the gray matter of the spinal cord has the appearance
of an ink-blot test, with the spread of the gray matter on one side
replicated on the other—a shape reminiscent of a bulbous capital “H.” As
shown in [\[link\]](#fig-ch13_02_09){: .autogenerated-content}, the gray
matter is subdivided into regions that are referred to as horns. The
<span data-type="term">posterior horn</span> is responsible for sensory
processing. The <span data-type="term">anterior horn</span> sends out
motor signals to the skeletal muscles. The <span
data-type="term">lateral horn</span>, which is only found in the
thoracic, upper lumbar, and sacral regions, is the central component of
the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.
{: #fs-id704969}

Some of the largest neurons of the spinal cord are the multipolar motor
neurons in the anterior horn. The fibers that cause contraction of
skeletal muscles are the axons of these neurons. The motor neuron that
causes contraction of the big toe, for example, is located in the sacral
spinal cord. The axon that has to reach all the way to the belly of that
muscle may be a meter in length. The neuronal cell body that maintains
that long fiber must be quite large, possibly several hundred
micrometers in diameter, making it one of the largest cells in the body.

## White Columns
{: data-type="title"}

Just as the gray matter is separated into horns, the white matter of the
spinal cord is separated into columns. <span data-type="term">Ascending
tracts</span> of nervous system fibers in these columns carry sensory
information up to the brain, whereas <span data-type="term">descending
tracts</span> carry motor commands from the brain. Looking at the spinal
cord longitudinally, the columns extend along its length as continuous
bands of white matter. Between the two posterior horns of gray matter
are the <span data-type="term">posterior columns</span>. Between the two
anterior horns, and bounded by the axons of motor neurons emerging from
that gray matter area, are the <span data-type="term">anterior
columns</span>. The white matter on either side of the spinal cord,
between the posterior horn and the axons of the anterior horn neurons,
are the <span data-type="term">lateral columns</span>. The posterior
columns are composed of axons of ascending tracts. The anterior and
lateral columns are composed of many different groups of axons of both
ascending and descending tracts—the latter carrying motor commands down
from the brain to the spinal cord to control output to the periphery.

Disorders of the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Basal Nuclei</span> Parkinson’s disease is a
disorder of the basal nuclei, specifically of the substantia nigra, that
demonstrates the effects of the direct and indirect pathways.
Parkinson’s disease is the result of neurons in the substantia nigra
pars compacta dying. These neurons release dopamine into the striatum.
Without that modulatory influence, the basal nuclei are stuck in the
indirect pathway, without the direct pathway being activated. The direct
pathway is responsible for increasing cortical movement commands. The
increased activity of the indirect pathway results in the hypokinetic
disorder of Parkinson’s disease.
{: #fs-id1467131}

Parkinson’s disease is neurodegenerative, meaning that neurons die that
cannot be replaced, so there is no cure for the disorder. Treatments for
Parkinson’s disease are aimed at increasing dopamine levels in the
striatum. Currently, the most common way of doing that is by providing
the amino acid L-DOPA, which is a precursor to the neurotransmitter
dopamine and can cross the blood-brain barrier. With levels of the
precursor elevated, the remaining cells of the substantia nigra pars
compacta can make more neurotransmitter and have a greater effect.
Unfortunately, the patient will become less responsive to L-DOPA
treatment as time progresses, and it can cause increased dopamine levels
elsewhere in the brain, which are associated with psychosis or
schizophrenia.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The adult brain is separated into four major regions: the cerebrum, the
diencephalon, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. The cerebrum is the
largest portion and contains the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei.
It is divided into two halves by the longitudinal fissure.
{: #fs-id793704}

The cortex is separated into the frontal, parietal, temporal, and
occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is responsible for motor functions,
from planning movements through executing commands to be sent to the
spinal cord and periphery. The most anterior portion of the frontal lobe
is the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with aspects of
personality through its influence on motor responses in decision-making.
{: #fs-id1595221}

The other lobes are responsible for sensory functions. The parietal lobe
is where somatosensation is processed. The occipital lobe is where
visual processing begins, although the other parts of the brain can
contribute to visual function. The temporal lobe contains the cortical
area for auditory processing, but also has regions crucial for memory
formation.
{: #fs-id850629}

Nuclei beneath the cerebral cortex, known as the subcortical nuclei, are
responsible for augmenting cortical functions. The basal nuclei receive
input from cortical areas and compare it with the general state of the
individual through the activity of a dopamine-releasing nucleus. The
output influences the activity of part of the thalamus that can then
increase or decrease cortical activity that often results in changes to
motor commands. The basal forebrain is responsible for modulating
cortical activity in attention and memory. The limbic system includes
deep cerebral nuclei that are responsible for emotion and memory.
{: #fs-id1534737}

The diencephalon includes the thalamus and the hypothalamus, along with
some other structures. The thalamus is a relay between the cerebrum and
the rest of the nervous system. The hypothalamus coordinates homeostatic
functions through the autonomic and endocrine systems.
{: #fs-id2338544}

The brain stem is composed of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. It
controls the head and neck region of the body through the cranial
nerves. There are control centers in the brain stem that regulate the
cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
{: #fs-id1174077}

The cerebellum is connected to the brain stem, primarily at the pons,
where it receives a copy of the descending input from the cerebrum to
the spinal cord. It can compare this with sensory feedback input through
the medulla and send output through the midbrain that can correct motor
commands for coordination.
