<span data-type="term">Pulmonary ventilation</span> is the act of
breathing, which can be described as the movement of air into and out of
the lungs. The major mechanisms that drive pulmonary ventilation are
atmospheric pressure (*P*{: data-effect="italics"}<sub>atm</sub>); the
air pressure within the alveoli, called alveolar pressure (*P*{:
data-effect="italics"}<sub>alv</sub>); and the pressure within the
pleural cavity, called intrapleural pressure (*P*{:

# Mechanisms of Breathing
{: data-type="title"}

The alveolar and intrapleural pressures are dependent on certain
physical features of the lung. However, the ability to breathe—to have
air enter the lungs during inspiration and air leave the lungs during
expiration—is dependent on the air pressure of the atmosphere and the
air pressure within the lungs.

## Pressure Relationships
{: data-type="title"}

Inspiration (or inhalation) and expiration (or exhalation) are dependent
on the differences in pressure between the atmosphere and the lungs. In
a gas, pressure is a force created by the movement of gas molecules that
are confined. For example, a certain number of gas molecules in a
two-liter container has more room than the same number of gas molecules
in a one-liter container ([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_03_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). In this case, the force exerted by the
movement of the gas molecules against the walls of the two-liter
container is lower than the force exerted by the gas molecules in the
one-liter container. Therefore, the pressure is lower in the two-liter
container and higher in the one-liter container. At a constant
temperature, changing the volume occupied by the gas changes the
pressure, as does changing the number of gas molecules. <span
data-type="term">Boyle’s law</span> describes the relationship between
volume and pressure in a gas at a constant temperature. Boyle discovered
that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume: If
volume increases, pressure decreases. Likewise, if volume decreases,
pressure increases. Pressure and volume are inversely related (*P*{:
data-effect="italics"} = k/*V*{: data-effect="italics"}). Therefore, the
pressure in the one-liter container (one-half the volume of the
two-liter container) would be twice the pressure in the two-liter
container. Boyle’s law is expressed by the following formula:
{: #fs-id2754129}

In this formula, *P*{: data-effect="italics"}<sub>1</sub> represents the

the initial volume, whereas the final pressure and volume are
represented by *P*{: data-effect="italics"}<sub>2</sub> and *V*{:
data-effect="italics"}<sub>2, </sub>respectively. If the two- and
one-liter containers were connected by a tube and the volume of one of
the containers were changed, then the gases would move from higher
pressure (lower volume) to lower pressure (higher volume).

Pulmonary ventilation is dependent on three types of pressure:
atmospheric, intra-alveolar, and interpleural. <span
data-type="term">Atmospheric pressure</span> is the amount of force that
is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface, such as
the body. Atmospheric pressure can be expressed in terms of the unit
atmosphere, abbreviated atm, or in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). One
atm is equal to 760 mm Hg, which is the atmospheric pressure at sea
level. Typically, for respiration, other pressure values are discussed
in relation to atmospheric pressure. Therefore, negative pressure is
pressure lower than the atmospheric pressure, whereas positive pressure
is pressure that it is greater than the atmospheric pressure. A pressure
that is equal to the atmospheric pressure is expressed as zero.
{: #fs-id2316302}

<span data-type="term">Intra-alveolar pressure</span> is the pressure of
the air within the alveoli, which changes during the different phases of
breathing ([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_03_02){: .autogenerated-content}).
Because the alveoli are connected to the atmosphere via the tubing of
the airways (similar to the two- and one-liter containers in the example
above), the interpulmonary pressure of the alveoli always equalizes with
the atmospheric pressure.

</figure>
<span data-type="term">Intrapleural pressure</span> is the pressure of
the air within the pleural cavity, between the visceral and parietal
pleurae. Similar to intra-alveolar pressure, intrapleural pressure also
changes during the different phases of breathing. However, due to
certain characteristics of the lungs, the intrapleural pressure is
always lower than, or negative to, the intra-alveolar pressure (and
therefore also to atmospheric pressure). Although it fluctuates during
inspiration and expiration, intrapleural pressure remains approximately
–4 mm Hg throughout the breathing cycle.
{: #fs-id2347851}

Competing forces within the thorax cause the formation of the negative
intrapleural pressure. One of these forces relates to the elasticity of
the lungs themselves—elastic tissue pulls the lungs inward, away from
the thoracic wall. Surface tension of alveolar fluid, which is mostly
water, also creates an inward pull of the lung tissue. This inward
tension from the lungs is countered by opposing forces from the pleural
fluid and thoracic wall. Surface tension within the pleural cavity pulls
the lungs outward. Too much or too little pleural fluid would hinder the
creation of the negative intrapleural pressure; therefore, the level
must be closely monitored by the mesothelial cells and drained by the
lymphatic system. Since the parietal pleura is attached to the thoracic
wall, the natural elasticity of the chest wall opposes the inward pull
of the lungs. Ultimately, the outward pull is slightly greater than the
inward pull, creating the –4 mm Hg intrapleural pressure relative to the
intra-alveolar pressure. <span data-type="term">Transpulmonary
pressure</span> is the difference between the intrapleural and
intra-alveolar pressures, and it determines the size of the lungs. A
higher transpulmonary pressure corresponds to a larger lung.

## Physical Factors Affecting Ventilation
{: data-type="title"}

In addition to the differences in pressures, breathing is also dependent
upon the contraction and relaxation of muscle fibers of both the
diaphragm and thorax. The lungs themselves are passive during breathing,
meaning they are not involved in creating the movement that helps
inspiration and expiration. This is because of the adhesive nature of
the pleural fluid, which allows the lungs to be pulled outward when the
thoracic wall moves during inspiration. The recoil of the thoracic wall
during expiration causes compression of the lungs. Contraction and
relaxation of the diaphragm and intercostals muscles (found between the
ribs) cause most of the pressure changes that result in inspiration and
expiration. These muscle movements and subsequent pressure changes cause
air to either rush in or be forced out of the lungs.
{: #fs-id1545698}

Other characteristics of the lungs influence the effort that must be
expended to ventilate. Resistance is a force that slows motion, in this
case, the flow of gases. The size of the airway is the primary factor
affecting resistance. A small tubular diameter forces air through a
smaller space, causing more collisions of air molecules with the walls
of the airways. The following formula helps to describe the relationship
between airway resistance and pressure changes:
{: #fs-id1285027}

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-248">

</div>
As noted earlier, there is surface tension within the alveoli caused by
water present in the lining of the alveoli. This surface tension tends
to inhibit expansion of the alveoli. However, pulmonary surfactant
secreted by type II alveolar cells mixes with that water and helps
reduce this surface tension. Without pulmonary surfactant, the alveoli
would collapse during expiration.
{: #fs-id1862104}

<span data-type="term">Thoracic wall compliance</span> is the ability of
the thoracic wall to stretch while under pressure. This can also affect
the effort expended in the process of breathing. In order for
inspiration to occur, the thoracic cavity must expand. The expansion of
the thoracic cavity directly influences the capacity of the lungs to
expand. If the tissues of the thoracic wall are not very compliant, it
will be difficult to expand the thorax to increase the size of the
lungs.

# Pulmonary Ventilation
{: data-type="title"}

The difference in pressures drives pulmonary ventilation because air
flows down a pressure gradient, that is, air flows from an area of
higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Air flows into the lungs
largely due to a difference in pressure; atmospheric pressure is greater
than intra-alveolar pressure, and intra-alveolar pressure is greater
than intrapleural pressure. Air flows out of the lungs during expiration
based on the same principle; pressure within the lungs becomes greater
than the atmospheric pressure.
{: #fs-id2241368}

Pulmonary ventilation comprises two major steps: inspiration and
expiration. <span data-type="term">Inspiration</span> is the process
that causes air to enter the lungs, and <span
data-type="term">expiration</span> is the process that causes air to
leave the lungs ([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_03_03){: .autogenerated-content}).
A <span data-type="term">respiratory cycle</span> is one sequence of
inspiration and expiration. In general, two muscle groups are used
during normal inspiration: the diaphragm and the external intercostal
muscles. Additional muscles can be used if a bigger breath is required.
When the diaphragm contracts, it moves inferiorly toward the abdominal
cavity, creating a larger thoracic cavity and more space for the lungs.
Contraction of the external intercostal muscles moves the ribs upward
and outward, causing the rib cage to expand, which increases the volume
of the thoracic cavity. Due to the adhesive force of the pleural fluid,
the expansion of the thoracic cavity forces the lungs to stretch and
expand as well. This increase in volume leads to a decrease in
intra-alveolar pressure, creating a pressure lower than atmospheric
pressure. As a result, a pressure gradient is created that drives air
into the lungs.

Inspiration and Expiration

</figure>
The process of normal expiration is passive, meaning that energy is not
required to push air out of the lungs. Instead, the elasticity of the
lung tissue causes the lung to recoil, as the diaphragm and intercostal
muscles relax following inspiration. In turn, the thoracic cavity and
lungs decrease in volume, causing an increase in interpulmonary
pressure. The interpulmonary pressure rises above atmospheric pressure,
creating a pressure gradient that causes air to leave the lungs.
{: #fs-id2453488}

There are different types, or modes, of breathing that require a
slightly different process to allow inspiration and expiration. <span
data-type="term">Quiet breathing</span>, also known as eupnea, is a mode
of breathing that occurs at rest and does not require the cognitive
thought of the individual. During quiet breathing, the diaphragm and
external intercostals must contract.
{: #fs-id2327717}

A deep breath, called diaphragmatic breathing, requires the diaphragm to
contract. As the diaphragm relaxes, air passively leaves the lungs. A
shallow breath, called costal breathing, requires contraction of the
intercostal muscles. As the intercostal muscles relax, air passively
leaves the lungs.
{: #fs-id2276812}

In contrast, <span data-type="term">forced breathing</span>, also known
as hyperpnea, is a mode of breathing that can occur during exercise or
actions that require the active manipulation of breathing, such as
singing. During forced breathing, inspiration and expiration both occur
due to muscle contractions. In addition to the contraction of the
diaphragm and intercostal muscles, other accessory muscles must also
contract. During forced inspiration, muscles of the neck, including the
scalenes, contract and lift the thoracic wall, increasing lung volume.
During forced expiration, accessory muscles of the abdomen, including
the obliques, contract, forcing abdominal organs upward against the
diaphragm. This helps to push the diaphragm further into the thorax,
pushing more air out. In addition, accessory muscles (primarily the
internal intercostals) help to compress the rib cage, which also reduces
the volume of the thoracic cavity.

# Respiratory Volumes and Capacities
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Respiratory volume</span> is the term used for
various volumes of air moved by or associated with the lungs at a given
point in the respiratory cycle. There are four major types of
respiratory volumes: tidal, residual, inspiratory reserve, and
expiratory reserve ([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_03_04){:
.autogenerated-content}). <span data-type="term">Tidal volume
(TV)</span> is the amount of air that normally enters the lungs during
quiet breathing, which is about 500 milliliters. <span
data-type="term">Expiratory reserve volume (ERV)</span> is the amount of
air you can forcefully exhale past a normal tidal expiration, up to 1200
milliliters for men. <span data-type="term">Inspiratory reserve volume
(IRV)</span> is produced by a deep inhalation, past a tidal inspiration.
This is the extra volume that can be brought into the lungs during a
forced inspiration. <span data-type="term">Residual volume (RV)</span>
is the air left in the lungs if you exhale as much air as possible. The
residual volume makes breathing easier by preventing the alveoli from
collapsing. Respiratory volume is dependent on a variety of factors, and
measuring the different types of respiratory volumes can provide
important clues about a person’s respiratory health
([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_03_05){: .autogenerated-content}).

# Respiratory Rate and Control of Ventilation
{: data-type="title"}

Breathing usually occurs without thought, although at times you can
consciously control it, such as when you swim under water, sing a song,
or blow bubbles. The <span data-type="term">respiratory rate</span> is
the total number of breaths, or respiratory cycles, that occur each
minute. Respiratory rate can be an important indicator of disease, as
the rate may increase or decrease during an illness or in a disease
condition. The respiratory rate is controlled by the respiratory center
located within the medulla oblongata in the brain, which responds
primarily to changes in carbon dioxide, oxygen, and pH levels in the
blood.
{: #fs-id2278288}

The normal respiratory rate of a child decreases from birth to
adolescence. A child under 1 year of age has a normal respiratory rate
between 30 and 60 breaths per minute, but by the time a child is about
10 years old, the normal rate is closer to 18 to 30. By adolescence, the
normal respiratory rate is similar to that of adults, 12 to 18 breaths
per minute.

## Ventilation Control Centers

The control of ventilation is a complex interplay of multiple regions in
the brain that signal the muscles used in pulmonary ventilation to
contract ([\[link\]](#tbl-ch23_01){: .autogenerated-content}). The
result is typically a rhythmic, consistent ventilation rate that
provides the body with sufficient amounts of oxygen, while adequately
removing carbon dioxide.

The medulla oblongata contains the <span data-type="term">dorsal
respiratory group (DRG)</span> and the <span data-type="term">ventral
respiratory group (VRG)</span>. The DRG is involved in maintaining a
constant breathing rhythm by stimulating the diaphragm and intercostal
muscles to contract, resulting in inspiration. When activity in the DRG
ceases, it no longer stimulates the diaphragm and intercostals to
contract, allowing them to relax, resulting in expiration. The VRG is
involved in forced breathing, as the neurons in the VRG stimulate the
accessory muscles involved in forced breathing to contract, resulting in
forced inspiration. The VRG also stimulates the accessory muscles
involved in forced expiration to contract.

The second respiratory center of the brain is located within the pons,

the DRG, controlling the depth of inspiration, particularly for deep
breathing. The <span data-type="term">pneumotaxic center</span> is a

## Factors That Affect the Rate and Depth of Respiration
{: data-type="title"}

The respiratory rate and the depth of inspiration are regulated by the
medulla oblongata and pons; however, these regions of the brain do so in
response to systemic stimuli. It is a dose-response, positive-feedback
relationship in which the greater the stimulus, the greater the
response. Thus, increasing stimuli results in forced breathing. Multiple
systemic factors are involved in stimulating the brain to produce
pulmonary ventilation.
{: #fs-id2129358}

The major factor that stimulates the medulla oblongata and pons to
produce respiration is surprisingly not oxygen concentration, but rather
the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. As you recall, carbon
dioxide is a waste product of cellular respiration and can be toxic.
Concentrations of chemicals are sensed by chemoreceptors. A <span
data-type="term">central chemoreceptor</span> is one of the specialized
receptors that are located in the brain and brainstem, whereas a <span
data-type="term">peripheral chemoreceptor</span> is one of the
specialized receptors located in the carotid arteries and aortic arch.
Concentration changes in certain substances, such as carbon dioxide or
hydrogen ions, stimulate these receptors, which in turn signal the
respiration centers of the brain. In the case of carbon dioxide, as the
concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood increases, it readily
diffuses across the blood-brain barrier, where it collects in the
extracellular fluid. As will be explained in more detail later,
increased carbon dioxide levels lead to increased levels of hydrogen
ions, decreasing pH. The increase in hydrogen ions in the brain triggers
the central chemoreceptors to stimulate the respiratory centers to
initiate contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. As a
result, the rate and depth of respiration increase, allowing more carbon
dioxide to be expelled, which brings more air into and out of the lungs
promoting a reduction in the blood levels of carbon dioxide, and
therefore hydrogen ions, in the blood. In contrast, low levels of carbon
dioxide in the blood cause low levels of hydrogen ions in the brain,
leading to a decrease in the rate and depth of pulmonary ventilation,
producing shallow, slow breathing.
{: #fs-id2010068}

Another factor involved in influencing the respiratory activity of the
brain is systemic arterial concentrations of hydrogen ions. Increasing
carbon dioxide levels can lead to increased H<sup>+</sup> levels, as
mentioned above, as well as other metabolic activities, such as lactic
acid accumulation after strenuous exercise. Peripheral chemoreceptors of
the aortic arch and carotid arteries sense arterial levels of hydrogen
ions. When peripheral chemoreceptors sense decreasing, or more acidic,
pH levels, they stimulate an increase in ventilation to remove carbon
dioxide from the blood at a quicker rate. Removal of carbon dioxide from
the blood helps to reduce hydrogen ions, thus increasing systemic pH.
{: #fs-id1482542}

Blood levels of oxygen are also important in influencing respiratory
rate. The peripheral chemoreceptors are responsible for sensing large
changes in blood oxygen levels. If blood oxygen levels become quite
low—about 60 mm Hg or less—then peripheral chemoreceptors stimulate an
increase in respiratory activity. The chemoreceptors are only able to
sense dissolved oxygen molecules, not the oxygen that is bound to
hemoglobin. As you recall, the majority of oxygen is bound by
hemoglobin; when dissolved levels of oxygen drop, hemoglobin releases
oxygen. Therefore, a large drop in oxygen levels is required to
stimulate the chemoreceptors of the aortic arch and carotid arteries.
{: #fs-id2378690}

The hypothalamus and other brain regions associated with the limbic
system also play roles in influencing the regulation of breathing by
interacting with the respiratory centers. The hypothalamus and other
regions associated with the limbic system are involved in regulating
respiration in response to emotions, pain, and temperature. For example,
an increase in body temperature causes an increase in respiratory rate.
Feeling excited or the fight-or-flight response will also result in an
increase in respiratory rate.

<span data-type="title">Respiratory System: Sleep Apnea</span> Sleep
apnea is a chronic disorder that can occur in children or adults, and is
characterized by the cessation of breathing during sleep. These episodes
may last for several seconds or several minutes, and may differ in the
frequency with which they are experienced. Sleep apnea leads to poor
sleep, which is reflected in the symptoms of fatigue, evening napping,
irritability, memory problems, and morning headaches. In addition, many
individuals with sleep apnea experience a dry throat in the morning
after waking from sleep, which may be due to excessive snoring.
{: #fs-id1983836}

There are two types of sleep apnea: obstructive sleep apnea and central
sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by an obstruction of the
airway during sleep, which can occur at different points in the airway,
depending on the underlying cause of the obstruction. For example, the
tongue and throat muscles of some individuals with obstructive sleep
apnea may relax excessively, causing the muscles to push into the
airway. Another example is obesity, which is a known risk factor for
sleep apnea, as excess adipose tissue in the neck region can push the
soft tissues towards the lumen of the airway, causing the trachea to
narrow.
{: #fs-id2057732}

In central sleep apnea, the respiratory centers of the brain do not
respond properly to rising carbon dioxide levels and therefore do not
stimulate the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles
regularly. As a result, inspiration does not occur and breathing stops
for a short period. In some cases, the cause of central sleep apnea is
unknown. However, some medical conditions, such as stroke and congestive
heart failure, may cause damage to the pons or medulla oblongata. In
addition, some pharmacologic agents, such as morphine, can affect the
respiratory centers, causing a decrease in the respiratory rate. The
symptoms of central sleep apnea are similar to those of obstructive
sleep apnea.
{: #fs-id2582598}

A diagnosis of sleep apnea is usually done during a sleep study, where
the patient is monitored in a sleep laboratory for several nights. The
patient’s blood oxygen levels, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood
pressure are monitored, as are brain activity and the volume of air that
is inhaled and exhaled. Treatment of sleep apnea commonly includes the
use of a device called a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
machine during sleep. The CPAP machine has a mask that covers the nose,
or the nose and mouth, and forces air into the airway at regular
intervals. This pressurized air can help to gently force the airway to
remain open, allowing more normal ventilation to occur. Other treatments
include lifestyle changes to decrease weight, eliminate alcohol and
other sleep apnea–promoting drugs, and changes in sleep position. In
addition to these treatments, patients with central sleep apnea may need
supplemental oxygen during sleep.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Pulmonary ventilation is the process of breathing, which is driven by
pressure differences between the lungs and the atmosphere. Atmospheric
pressure is the force exerted by gases present in the atmosphere. The
force exerted by gases within the alveoli is called intra-alveolar
(intrapulmonary) pressure, whereas the force exerted by gases in the
pleural cavity is called intrapleural pressure. Typically, intrapleural
pressure is lower, or negative to, intra-alveolar pressure. The
difference in pressure between intrapleural and intra-alveolar pressures
is called transpulmonary pressure. In addition, intra-alveolar pressure
will equalize with the atmospheric pressure. Pressure is determined by
the volume of the space occupied by a gas and is influenced by
resistance. Air flows when a pressure gradient is created, from a space
of higher pressure to a space of lower pressure. Boyle’s law describes
the relationship between volume and pressure. A gas is at lower pressure
in a larger volume because the gas molecules have more space to in which
to move. The same quantity of gas in a smaller volume results in gas
molecules crowding together, producing increased pressure.
{: #fs-id2079558}

Resistance is created by inelastic surfaces, as well as the diameter of
the airways. Resistance reduces the flow of gases. The surface tension
of the alveoli also influences pressure, as it opposes the expansion of
the alveoli. However, pulmonary surfactant helps to reduce the surface
tension so that the alveoli do not collapse during expiration. The
ability of the lungs to stretch, called lung compliance, also plays a
role in gas flow. The more the lungs can stretch, the greater the
potential volume of the lungs. The greater the volume of the lungs, the
lower the air pressure within the lungs.
{: #fs-id2371155}

Pulmonary ventilation consists of the process of inspiration (or
inhalation), where air enters the lungs, and expiration (or exhalation),
where air leaves the lungs. During inspiration, the diaphragm and
external intercostal muscles contract, causing the rib cage to expand
and move outward, and expanding the thoracic cavity and lung volume.
This creates a lower pressure within the lung than that of the
atmosphere, causing air to be drawn into the lungs. During expiration,
the diaphragm and intercostals relax, causing the thorax and lungs to
recoil. The air pressure within the lungs increases to above the
pressure of the atmosphere, causing air to be forced out of the lungs.
However, during forced exhalation, the internal intercostals and
abdominal muscles may be involved in forcing air out of the lungs.
{: #fs-id2344854}

Respiratory volume describes the amount of air in a given space within
the lungs, or which can be moved by the lung, and is dependent on a
variety of factors. Tidal volume refers to the amount of air that enters
the lungs during quiet breathing, whereas inspiratory reserve volume is
the amount of air that enters the lungs when a person inhales past the
tidal volume. Expiratory reserve volume is the extra amount of air that
can leave with forceful expiration, following tidal expiration. Residual
volume is the amount of air that is left in the lungs after expelling
the expiratory reserve volume. Respiratory capacity is the combination
of two or more volumes. Anatomical dead space refers to the air within
the respiratory structures that never participates in gas exchange,
because it does not reach functional alveoli. Respiratory rate is the
number of breaths taken per minute, which may change during certain
diseases or conditions.
{: #fs-id2626519}

Both respiratory rate and depth are controlled by the respiratory
centers of the brain, which are stimulated by factors such as chemical
and pH changes in the blood. These changes are sensed by central
chemoreceptors, which are located in the brain, and peripheral
chemoreceptors, which are located in the aortic arch and carotid
arteries. A rise in carbon dioxide or a decline in oxygen levels in the
blood stimulates an increase in respiratory rate and depth.

Patients with respiratory ailments (such as asthma, emphysema, COPD,
etc.) have issues with airway resistance and/or lung compliance. Both of
these factors can interfere with the patient’s ability to move air
effectively. A spirometry test can determine how much air the patient
can move into and out of the lungs. If the air volumes are low, this can
indicate that the patient has a respiratory disease or that the
treatment regimen may need to be adjusted. If the numbers are normal,
the patient does not have a significant respiratory disease or the
treatment regimen is working as expected.

Lung compliance refers to the ability of lung tissue to stretch under
pressure, which is determined in part by the surface tension of the
alveoli and the ability of the connective tissue to stretch. Lung
compliance plays a role in determining how much the lungs can change in

{: #fs-id1525882}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id2137966" data-label="" markdown="1">
Quiet breathing occurs at rest and without active thought. During quiet
breathing, the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles work at
different extents, depending on the situation. For inspiration, the
diaphragm contracts, causing the diaphragm to flatten and drop towards
the abdominal cavity, helping to expand the thoracic cavity. The
external intercostal muscles contract as well, causing the rib cage to
expand, and the rib cage and sternum to move outward, also expanding the
thoracic cavity. Expansion of the thoracic cavity also causes the lungs
to expand, due to the adhesiveness of the pleural fluid. As a result,
the pressure within the lungs drops below that of the atmosphere,
causing air to rush into the lungs. In contrast, expiration is a passive
process. As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, the lungs and
thoracic tissues recoil, and the volume of the lungs decreases. This
causes the pressure within the lungs to increase above that of the
atmosphere, causing air to leave the lungs.

Respiratory rate is defined as the number of breaths taken per minute.
Respiratory rate is controlled by the respiratory center, located in the
medulla oblongata. Conscious thought can alter the normal respiratory
rate through control by skeletal muscle, although one cannot consciously
stop the rate altogether. A typical resting respiratory rate is about 14
breaths per minute.
