The role of the cerebellum is a subject of debate. There is an obvious
connection to motor function based on the clinical implications of
cerebellar damage. There is also strong evidence of the cerebellar role
in procedural memory. The two are not incompatible; in fact, procedural
memory is motor memory, such as learning to ride a bicycle. Significant
work has been performed to describe the connections within the
cerebellum that result in learning. A model for this learning is
classical conditioning, as shown by the famous dogs from the
physiologist Ivan Pavlov’s work. This classical conditioning, which can
be related to motor learning, fits with the neural connections of the
cerebellum. The cerebellum is 10 percent of the mass of the brain and
has varied functions that all point to a role in the motor system.

# Location and Connections of the Cerebellum
{: data-type="title"}

The cerebellum is located in apposition to the dorsal surface of the
brain stem, centered on the pons. The name of the pons is derived from
its connection to the cerebellum. The word means “bridge” and refers to
the thick bundle of myelinated axons that form a bulge on its ventral
surface. Those fibers are axons that project from the gray matter of the
pons into the contralateral cerebellar cortex. These fibers make up the
<span data-type="term">middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP)</span> and are
the major physical connection of the cerebellum to the brain stem
([\[link\]](#fig-ch16_05_01){: .autogenerated-content}). Two other white
matter bundles connect the cerebellum to the other regions of the brain
stem. The <span data-type="term">superior cerebellar peduncle
(SCP)</span> is the connection of the cerebellum to the midbrain and
forebrain. The <span data-type="term">inferior cerebellar peduncle
(ICP)</span> is the connection to the medulla.
{: #fs-id2252793}

<div data-type="title">
Cerebellar Penduncles
</div>
<figcaption>
The connections to the cerebellum are the three cerebellar peduncles,
which are close to each other. The ICP arises from the
medulla—specifically from the inferior olive, which is visible as a
bulge on the ventral surface of the brain stem. The MCP is the ventral
surface of the pons. The SCP projects into the midbrain.
</figcaption>
<span markdown="1" data-type="media" id="fs-id2242525" data-alt="This image shows the

peduncles labeled.](../resources/1612_Cerebellar_Peduncles-02.jpg){:
data-media-type="image/jpg" width="370"} </span>
</figure>
These connections can also be broadly described by their functions. The
ICP conveys sensory input to the cerebellum, partially from the
spinocerebellar tract, but also through fibers of the <span
data-type="term">inferior olive</span>. The MCP is part of the <span
data-type="term">cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway</span> that connects
the cerebral cortex with the cerebellum and preferentially targets the
lateral regions of the cerebellum. It includes a copy of the motor
commands sent from the precentral gyrus through the corticospinal tract,
arising from collateral branches that synapse in the gray matter of the
pons, along with input from other regions such as the visual cortex. The
SCP is the major output of the cerebellum, divided between the <span
data-type="term">red nucleus</span> in the midbrain and the thalamus,
which will return cerebellar processing to the motor cortex. These
connections describe a circuit that compares motor commands and sensory
feedback to generate a new output. These comparisons make it possible to
coordinate movements. If the cerebral cortex sends a motor command to
initiate walking, that command is copied by the pons and sent into the
cerebellum through the MCP. Sensory feedback in the form of
proprioception from the spinal cord, as well as vestibular sensations
from the inner ear, enters through the ICP. If you take a step and begin
to slip on the floor because it is wet, the output from the
cerebellum—through the SCP—can correct for that and keep you balanced
and moving. The red nucleus sends new motor commands to the spinal cord
through the <span data-type="term">rubrospinal tract</span>.
{: #fs-id2307969}

The cerebellum is divided into regions that are based on the particular
functions and connections involved. The midline regions of the
cerebellum, the <span data-type="term">vermis</span> and <span
data-type="term">flocculonodular lobe</span>, are involved in comparing
visual information, equilibrium, and proprioceptive feedback to maintain
balance and coordinate movements such as walking, or <span
data-type="term">gait</span>, through the descending output of the red
nucleus ([\[link\]](#fig-ch16_05_02){: .autogenerated-content}). The
lateral hemispheres are primarily concerned with planning motor
functions through frontal lobe inputs that are returned through the
thalamic projections back to the premotor and motor cortices. Processing
in the midline regions targets movements of the axial musculature,
whereas the lateral regions target movements of the appendicular
musculature. The vermis is referred to as the <span
data-type="term">spinocerebellum</span> because it primarily receives
input from the dorsal columns and spinocerebellar pathways. The
flocculonodular lobe is referred to as the <span
data-type="term">vestibulocerebellum</span> because of the vestibular
projection into that region. Finally, the lateral cerebellum is referred
to as the <span data-type="term">cerebrocerebellum</span>, reflecting
the significant input from the cerebral cortex through the
cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway.

# Coordination and Alternating Movement
{: data-type="title"}

Testing for cerebellar function is the basis of the coordination exam.
The subtests target appendicular musculature, controlling the limbs, and
axial musculature for posture and gait. The assessment of cerebellar
function will depend on the normal functioning of other systems
addressed in previous sections of the neurological exam. Motor control
from the cerebrum, as well as sensory input from somatic, visual, and
vestibular senses, are important to cerebellar function.
{: #fs-id2309111}

The subtests that address appendicular musculature, and therefore the
lateral regions of the cerebellum, begin with a check for tremor. The
patient extends their arms in front of them and holds the position. The
examiner watches for the presence of tremors that would not be present
if the muscles are relaxed. By pushing down on the arms in this
position, the examiner can check for the rebound response, which is when
the arms are automatically brought back to the extended position. The
extension of the arms is an ongoing motor process, and the tap or push
on the arms presents a change in the proprioceptive feedback. The
cerebellum compares the cerebral motor command with the proprioceptive
feedback and adjusts the descending input to correct. The red nucleus
would send an additional signal to the LMN for the arm to increase
contraction momentarily to overcome the change and regain the original
position.
{: #fs-id1284478}

The <span data-type="term">check reflex</span> depends on cerebellar
input to keep increased contraction from continuing after the removal of
resistance. The patient flexes the elbow against resistance from the
examiner to extend the elbow. When the examiner releases the arm, the
patient should be able to stop the increased contraction and keep the
arm from moving. A similar response would be seen if you try to pick up
a coffee mug that you believe to be full but turns out to be empty.
Without checking the contraction, the mug would be thrown from the
overexertion of the muscles expecting to lift a heavier object.
{: #fs-id2306534}

Several subtests of the cerebellum assess the ability to alternate
movements, or switch between muscle groups that may be antagonistic to
each other. In the finger-to-nose test, the patient touches their finger
to the examiner’s finger and then to their nose, and then back to the
examiner’s finger, and back to the nose. The examiner moves the target
finger to assess a range of movements. A similar test for the lower
extremities has the patient touch their toe to a moving target, such as
the examiner’s finger. Both of these tests involve flexion and extension
around a joint—the elbow or the knee and the shoulder or hip—as well as
movements of the wrist and ankle. The patient must switch between the
opposing muscles, like the biceps and triceps brachii, to move their
finger from the target to their nose. Coordinating these movements
involves the motor cortex communicating with the cerebellum through the
pons and feedback through the thalamus to plan the movements. Visual
cortex information is also part of the processing that occurs in the
cerebrocerebellum while it is involved in guiding movements of the
finger or toe.
{: #fs-id1335742}

Rapid, alternating movements are tested for the upper and lower
extremities. The patient is asked to touch each finger to their thumb,
or to pat the palm of one hand on the back of the other, and then flip
that hand over and alternate back-and-forth. To test similar function in
the lower extremities, the patient touches their heel to their shin near
the knee and slides it down toward the ankle, and then back again,
repetitively. Rapid, alternating movements are part of speech as well. A
patient is asked to repeat the nonsense consonants “lah-kah-pah” to
alternate movements of the tongue, lips, and palate. All of these rapid
alternations require planning from the cerebrocerebellum to coordinate
movement commands that control the coordination.

# Posture and Gait
{: data-type="title"}

Gait can either be considered a separate part of the neurological exam
or a subtest of the coordination exam that addresses walking and
balance. Testing posture and gait addresses functions of the
spinocerebellum and the vestibulocerebellum because both are part of
these activities. A subtest called station begins with the patient
standing in a normal position to check for the placement of the feet and
balance. The patient is asked to hop on one foot to assess the ability
to maintain balance and posture during movement. Though the station
subtest appears to be similar to the Romberg test, the difference is
that the patient’s eyes are open during station. The Romberg test has
the patient stand still with the eyes closed. Any changes in posture
would be the result of proprioceptive deficits, and the patient is able
to recover when they open their eyes.
{: #fs-id1547688}

Subtests of walking begin with having the patient walk normally for a
distance away from the examiner, and then turn and return to the
starting position. The examiner watches for abnormal placement of the
feet and the movement of the arms relative to the movement. The patient
is then asked to walk with a few different variations. Tandem gait is
when the patient places the heel of one foot against the toe of the
other foot and walks in a straight line in that manner. Walking only on
the heels or only on the toes will test additional aspects of balance.

# Ataxia
{: data-type="title"}

A movement disorder of the cerebellum is referred to as <span
data-type="term">ataxia</span>. It presents as a loss of coordination in
voluntary movements. Ataxia can also refer to sensory deficits that
cause balance problems, primarily in proprioception and equilibrium.
When the problem is observed in movement, it is ascribed to cerebellar
damage. Sensory and vestibular ataxia would likely also present with
problems in gait and station.
{: #fs-id1339156}

Ataxia is often the result of exposure to exogenous substances, focal
lesions, or a genetic disorder. Focal lesions include strokes affecting
the cerebellar arteries, tumors that may impinge on the cerebellum,
trauma to the back of the head and neck, or MS. Alcohol intoxication or
drugs such as ketamine cause ataxia, but it is often reversible. Mercury
in fish can cause ataxia as well. Hereditary conditions can lead to
degeneration of the cerebellum or spinal cord, as well as malformation
of the brain, or the abnormal accumulation of copper seen in Wilson’s
disease.

Watch this short [video][1] to see a test for station. Station refers to
the position a person adopts when they are standing still. The examiner
would look for issues with balance, which coordinates proprioceptive,
vestibular, and visual information in the cerebellum. To test the
ability of a subject to maintain balance, asking them to stand or hop on
one foot can be more demanding. The examiner may also push the subject
to see if they can maintain balance. An abnormal finding in the test of
station is if the feet are placed far apart. Why would a wide stance
suggest problems with cerebellar function?

Everyday Connections

<span data-type="title">The Field Sobriety Test</span> The neurological
exam has been described as a clinical tool throughout this chapter. It
is also useful in other ways. A variation of the coordination exam is
the Field Sobriety Test (FST) used to assess whether drivers are under
the influence of alcohol. The cerebellum is crucial for coordinated
movements such as keeping balance while walking, or moving appendicular
musculature on the basis of proprioceptive feedback. The cerebellum is
also very sensitive to ethanol, the particular type of alcohol found in
beer, wine, and liquor.
{: #fs-id2278336}

Walking in a straight line involves comparing the motor command from the
primary motor cortex to the proprioceptive and vestibular sensory
feedback, as well as following the visual guide of the white line on the
side of the road. When the cerebellum is compromised by alcohol, the
cerebellum cannot coordinate these movements effectively, and
maintaining balance becomes difficult.
{: #fs-id2517143}

Another common aspect of the FST is to have the driver extend their arms
out wide and touch their fingertip to their nose, usually with their
eyes closed. The point of this is to remove the visual feedback for the
movement and force the driver to rely just on proprioceptive information
about the movement and position of their fingertip relative to their
nose. With eyes open, the corrections to the movement of the arm might
be so small as to be hard to see, but proprioceptive feedback is not as
immediate and broader movements of the arm will probably be needed,
particularly if the cerebellum is affected by alcohol.
{: #fs-id1470193}

Reciting the alphabet backwards is not always a component of the FST,
but its relationship to neurological function is interesting. There is a
cognitive aspect to remembering how the alphabet goes and how to recite
it backwards. That is actually a variation of the mental status subtest
of repeating the months backwards. However, the cerebellum is important
because speech production is a coordinated activity. The speech rapid
alternating movement subtest is specifically using the consonant changes
of “lah-kah-pah” to assess coordinated movements of the lips, tongue,
pharynx, and palate. But the entire alphabet, especially in the
nonrehearsed backwards order, pushes this type of coordinated movement
quite far. It is related to the reason that speech becomes slurred when
a person is intoxicated.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The cerebellum is an important part of motor function in the nervous
system. It apparently plays a role in procedural learning, which would
include motor skills such as riding a bike or throwing a football. The
basis for these roles is likely to be tied into the role the cerebellum
plays as a comparator for voluntary movement.
{: #fs-id1637324}

The motor commands from the cerebral hemispheres travel along the
corticospinal pathway, which passes through the pons. Collateral
branches of these fibers synapse on neurons in the pons, which then
project into the cerebellar cortex through the middle cerebellar
peduncles. Ascending sensory feedback, entering through the inferior
cerebellar peduncles, provides information about motor performance. The
cerebellar cortex compares the command to the actual performance and can
adjust the descending input to compensate for any mismatch. The output
from deep cerebellar nuclei projects through the superior cerebellar
peduncles to initiate descending signals from the red nucleus to the
spinal cord.
{: #fs-id2609501}

The primary role of the cerebellum in relation to the spinal cord is
through the spinocerebellum; it controls posture and gait with
significant input from the vestibular system. Deficits in cerebellar
function result in ataxias, or a specific kind of movement disorder. The
root cause of the ataxia may be the sensory input—either the
proprioceptive input from the spinal cord or the equilibrium input from
the vestibular system, or direct damage to the cerebellum by stroke,
trauma, hereditary factors, or toxins.
