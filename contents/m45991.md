For thousands of years, fear of the dead and legal sanctions limited the
ability of anatomists and physicians to study the internal structures of
the human body. An inability to control bleeding, infection, and pain
made surgeries infrequent, and those that were performed—such as wound
suturing, amputations, tooth and tumor removals, skull drilling, and
cesarean births—did not greatly advance knowledge about internal
anatomy. Theories about the function of the body and about disease were
therefore largely based on external observations and imagination. During
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however, the detailed anatomical
drawings of Italian artist and anatomist Leonardo da Vinci and Flemish
anatomist Andreas Vesalius were published, and interest in human anatomy
began to increase. Medical schools began to teach anatomy using human
dissection; although some resorted to grave robbing to obtain corpses.
Laws were eventually passed that enabled students to dissect the corpses
of criminals and those who donated their bodies for research. Still, it
was not until the late nineteenth century that medical researchers
discovered non-surgical methods to look inside the living body.

# X-Rays
{: data-type="title"}

German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen (1845–1923) was experimenting with
electrical current when he discovered that a mysterious and invisible
“ray” would pass through his flesh but leave an outline of his bones on
a screen coated with a metal compound. In 1895, Röntgen made the first
durable record of the internal parts of a living human: an “X-ray” image
(as it came to be called) of his wife’s hand. Scientists around the
world quickly began their own experiments with X-rays, and by 1900,
X-rays were widely used to detect a variety of injuries and diseases. In
1901, Röntgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize for physics for his work
in this field.

The <span data-type="term">X-ray</span> is a form of high energy
electromagnetic radiation with a short wavelength capable of penetrating
solids and ionizing gases. As they are used in medicine, X-rays are
emitted from an X-ray machine and directed toward a specially treated
metallic plate placed behind the patient’s body. The beam of radiation
results in darkening of the X-ray plate. X-rays are slightly impeded by
soft tissues, which show up as gray on the X-ray plate, whereas hard
tissues, such as bone, largely block the rays, producing a light-toned
“shadow.” Thus, X-rays are best used to visualize hard body structures
such as teeth and bones ([\[link\]](#fig-ch01_07_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). Like many forms of high energy radiation,
however, X-rays are capable of damaging cells and initiating changes
that can lead to cancer. This danger of excessive exposure to X-rays was
not fully appreciated for many years after their widespread use.

Refinements and enhancements of X-ray techniques have continued
throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Although often
supplanted by more sophisticated imaging techniques, the X-ray remains a
“workhorse” in medical imaging, especially for viewing fractures and for
dentistry. The disadvantage of irradiation to the patient and the
operator is now attenuated by proper shielding and by limiting exposure.

# Modern Medical Imaging
{: data-type="title"}

X-rays can depict a two-dimensional image of a body region, and only
from a single angle. In contrast, more recent medical imaging
technologies produce data that is integrated and analyzed by computers
to produce three-dimensional images or images that reveal aspects of
body functioning.

## Computed Tomography
{: data-type="title"}

Tomography refers to imaging by sections. <span
data-type="term">Computed tomography (CT)</span> is a noninvasive
imaging technique that uses computers to analyze several cross-sectional
X-rays in order to reveal minute details about structures in the body
([\[link\]](#fig-ch01_07_02){: .autogenerated-content}**a**{:
data-effect="bold"}). The technique was invented in the 1970s and is
based on the principle that, as X-rays pass through the body, they are
absorbed or reflected at different levels. In the technique, a patient
lies on a motorized platform while a computerized axial tomography (CAT)
scanner rotates 360 degrees around the patient, taking X-ray images. A
computer combines these images into a two-dimensional view of the
scanned area, or “slice.”

Since 1970, the development of more powerful computers and more
sophisticated software has made CT scanning routine for many types of
diagnostic evaluations. It is especially useful for soft tissue
scanning, such as of the brain and the thoracic and abdominal viscera.
Its level of detail is so precise that it can allow physicians to
measure the size of a mass down to a millimeter. The main disadvantage
of CT scanning is that it exposes patients to a dose of radiation many
times higher than that of X-rays. In fact, children who undergo CT scans
are at increased risk of developing cancer, as are adults who have
multiple CT scans.

## Magnetic Resonance Imaging
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</span> is a
noninvasive medical imaging technique based on a phenomenon of nuclear
physics discovered in the 1930s, in which matter exposed to magnetic
fields and radio waves was found to emit radio signals. In 1970, a
physician and researcher named Raymond Damadian noticed that malignant
(cancerous) tissue gave off different signals than normal body tissue.
He applied for a patent for the first MRI scanning device, which was in
use clinically by the early 1980s. The early MRI scanners were crude,
but advances in digital computing and electronics led to their
advancement over any other technique for precise imaging, especially to
discover tumors. MRI also has the major advantage of not exposing
patients to radiation.
{: #fs-id2523214}

Drawbacks of MRI scans include their much higher cost, and patient
discomfort with the procedure. The MRI scanner subjects the patient to
such powerful electromagnets that the scan room must be shielded. The
patient must be enclosed in a metal tube-like device for the duration of
the scan (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch01_07_02){:
.autogenerated-content}**b**{: data-effect="bold"}), sometimes as long
as thirty minutes, which can be uncomfortable and impractical for ill
patients. The device is also so noisy that, even with earplugs, patients
can become anxious or even fearful. These problems have been overcome
somewhat with the development of “open” MRI scanning, which does not
require the patient to be entirely enclosed in the metal tube. Patients
with iron-containing metallic implants (internal sutures, some
prosthetic devices, and so on) cannot undergo MRI scanning because it
can dislodge these implants.
{: #fs-id1960262}

Functional MRIs (fMRIs), which detect the concentration of blood flow in
certain parts of the body, are increasingly being used to study the
activity in parts of the brain during various body activities. This has
helped scientists learn more about the locations of different brain
functions and more about brain abnormalities and diseases.

## Positron Emission Tomography
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Positron emission tomography (PET)</span> is a
medical imaging technique involving the use of so-called
radiopharmaceuticals, substances that emit radiation that is short-lived
and therefore relatively safe to administer to the body. Although the
first PET scanner was introduced in 1961, it took 15 more years before
radiopharmaceuticals were combined with the technique and revolutionized
its potential. The main advantage is that PET (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch01_07_02){: .autogenerated-content}**c**{:
data-effect="bold"}) can illustrate physiologic activity—including
nutrient metabolism and blood flow—of the organ or organs being
targeted, whereas CT and MRI scans can only show static images. PET is
widely used to diagnose a multitude of conditions, such as heart
disease, the spread of cancer, certain forms of infection, brain
abnormalities, bone disease, and thyroid disease.

## Ultrasonography
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Ultrasonography</span> is an imaging technique
that uses the transmission of high-frequency sound waves into the body
to generate an echo signal that is converted by a computer into a
real-time image of anatomy and physiology (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch01_07_02){: .autogenerated-content}**d**{:
data-effect="bold"}). Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all
imaging techniques, and it is therefore used more freely in sensitive
situations such as pregnancy. The technology was first developed in the
1940s and 1950s. Ultrasonography is used to study heart function, blood
flow in the neck or extremities, certain conditions such as gallbladder
disease, and fetal growth and development. The main disadvantages of
ultrasonography are that the image quality is heavily operator-dependent
and that it is unable to penetrate bone and gas.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Detailed anatomical drawings of the human body first became available in
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; however, it was not until the end
of the nineteenth century, and the discovery of X-rays, that anatomists
and physicians discovered non-surgical methods to look inside a living
body. Since then, many other techniques, including CT scans, MRI scans,
PET scans, and ultrasonography, have been developed, providing more
accurate and detailed views of the form and function of the human body.
