The immune system can be divided into two overlapping mechanisms to
destroy pathogens: the innate immune response, which is relatively rapid
but nonspecific and thus not always effective, and the adaptive immune
response, which is slower in its development during an initial infection
with a pathogen, but is highly specific and effective at attacking a
wide variety of pathogens ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_02_01){:
.autogenerated-content}).

Any discussion of the innate immune response usually begins with the
physical barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body, destroy
them after they enter, or flush them out before they can establish
themselves in the hospitable environment of the body’s soft tissues.
Barrier defenses are part of the body’s most basic defense mechanisms.
The barrier defenses are not a response to infections, but they are
continuously working to protect against a broad range of pathogens.
{: #fs-id1905697}

The different modes of barrier defenses are associated with the external
surfaces of the body, where pathogens may try to enter
([\[link\]](#tbl-ch22_02){: .autogenerated-content}). The primary
barrier to the entrance of microorganisms into the body is the skin. Not
only is the skin covered with a layer of dead, keratinized epithelium
that is too dry for bacteria in which to grow, but as these cells are
continuously sloughed off from the skin, they carry bacteria and other
pathogens with them. Additionally, sweat and other skin secretions may
lower pH, contain toxic lipids, and physically wash microbes away.
{: #fs-id1549116}

<table id="tbl-ch22_02" summary=""><thead> <tr> <th colspan="3">Barrier Defenses</th> </tr> <tr> <th>Site</th> <th>Specific defense</th> <th>Protective aspect</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr><td>Skin</td> <td>Epidermal surface</td> <td>Keratinized cells of surface, Langerhans cells</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Skin (sweat/secretions)</td> <td>Sweat glands, sebaceous glands</td> <td>Low pH, washing action</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Oral cavity</td> <td>Salivary glands</td> <td>Lysozyme</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stomach</td> <td>Gastrointestinal tract</td> <td>Low pH</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mucosal surfaces</td> <td>Mucosal epithelium</td> <td>Nonkeratinized epithelial cells</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Normal flora (nonpathogenic bacteria)</td> <td>Mucosal tissues</td> <td>Prevent pathogens from growing on mucosal surfaces</td> </tr> </tbody></table>
Another barrier is the saliva in the mouth, which is rich in lysozyme—an
enzyme that destroys bacteria by digesting their cell walls. The acidic
environment of the stomach, which is fatal to many pathogens, is also a
barrier. Additionally, the mucus layer of the gastrointestinal tract,
respiratory tract, reproductive tract, eyes, ears, and nose traps both
microbes and debris, and facilitates their removal. In the case of the
upper respiratory tract, ciliated epithelial cells move potentially
contaminated mucus upwards to the mouth, where it is then swallowed into
the digestive tract, ending up in the harsh acidic environment of the
stomach. Considering how often you breathe compared to how often you eat
or perform other activities that expose you to pathogens, it is not
surprising that multiple barrier mechanisms have evolved to work in
concert to protect this vital area.

# Cells of the Innate Immune Response
{: data-type="title"}

A phagocyte is a cell that is able to surround and engulf a particle or
cell, a process called <span data-type="term">phagocytosis</span>. The
phagocytes of the immune system engulf other particles or cells, either
to clean an area of debris, old cells, or to kill pathogenic organisms
such as bacteria. The phagocytes are the body’s fast acting, first line
of immunological defense against organisms that have breached barrier
defenses and have entered the vulnerable tissues of the body.
{: #fs-id2305166}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1489572" markdown="1">
## Phagocytes: Macrophages and Neutrophils
{: data-type="title"}

Many of the cells of the immune system have a phagocytic ability, at
least at some point during their life cycles. Phagocytosis is an
important and effective mechanism of destroying pathogens during innate
immune responses. The phagocyte takes the organism inside itself as a
phagosome, which subsequently fuses with a lysosome and its digestive
enzymes, effectively killing many pathogens. On the other hand, some
bacteria including *Mycobacteria tuberculosis*{: data-effect="italics"},
the cause of tuberculosis, may be resistant to these enzymes and are
therefore much more difficult to clear from the body. Macrophages,
neutrophils, and dendritic cells are the major phagocytes of the immune
system.
{: #fs-id2443755}

A <span data-type="term">macrophage</span> is an irregularly shaped
phagocyte that is amoeboid in nature and is the most versatile of the
phagocytes in the body. Macrophages move through tissues and squeeze
through capillary walls using pseudopodia. They not only participate in
innate immune responses but have also evolved to cooperate with
lymphocytes as part of the adaptive immune response. Macrophages exist
in many tissues of the body, either freely roaming through connective
tissues or fixed to reticular fibers within specific tissues such as
lymph nodes. When pathogens breach the body’s barrier defenses,
macrophages are the first line of defense ([\[link\]](#tbl-ch22_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). They are called different names, depending on
the tissue: Kupffer cells in the liver, histiocytes in connective
tissue, and alveolar macrophages in the lungs.
{: #fs-id2170684}

A <span data-type="term">neutrophil</span> is a phagocytic cell that is
attracted via chemotaxis from the bloodstream to infected tissues. These
spherical cells are granulocytes. A granulocyte contains cytoplasmic
granules, which in turn contain a variety of vasoactive mediators such
as histamine. In contrast, macrophages are agranulocytes. An
agranulocyte has few or no cytoplasmic granules. Whereas macrophages act
like sentries, always on guard against infection, neutrophils can be
thought of as military reinforcements that are called into a battle to
hasten the destruction of the enemy. Although, usually thought of as the
primary pathogen-killing cell of the inflammatory process of the innate
immune response, new research has suggested that neutrophils play a role
in the adaptive immune response as well, just as macrophages do.
{: #fs-id1290138}

A <span data-type="term">monocyte</span> is a circulating precursor cell
that differentiates into either a macrophage or dendritic cell, which
can be rapidly attracted to areas of infection by signal molecules of
inflammation.

## Natural Killer Cells
{: data-type="title"}

NK cells are a type of lymphocyte that have the ability to induce
apoptosis, that is, programmed cell death, in cells infected with
intracellular pathogens such as obligate intracellular bacteria and
viruses. NK cells recognize these cells by mechanisms that are still not
well understood, but that presumably involve their surface receptors. NK
cells can induce apoptosis, in which a cascade of events inside the cell
causes its own death by either of two mechanisms:
{: #fs-id1375559}

1) NK cells are able to respond to chemical signals and express the fas
ligand. The <span data-type="term">fas ligand</span> is a surface
molecule that binds to the fas molecule on the surface of the infected
cell, sending it apoptotic signals, thus killing the cell and the
pathogen within it; or
{: #fs-id2520504}

2) The granules of the NK cells release perforins and granzymes. A <span
data-type="term">perforin</span> is a protein that forms pores in the
membranes of infected cells. A <span data-type="term">granzyme</span> is
a protein-digesting enzyme that enters the cell via the perforin pores
and triggers apoptosis intracellularly.
{: #fs-id2327594}

Both mechanisms are especially effective against virally infected cells.
If apoptosis is induced before the virus has the ability to synthesize
and assemble all its components, no infectious virus will be released
from the cell, thus preventing further infection.

# Recognition of Pathogens
{: data-type="title"}

Cells of the innate immune response, the phagocytic cells, and the
cytotoxic NK cells recognize patterns of pathogen-specific molecules,
such as bacterial cell wall components or bacterial flagellar proteins,
using pattern recognition receptors. A <span data-type="term">pattern
recognition receptor (PRR)</span> is a membrane-bound receptor that
recognizes characteristic features of a pathogen and molecules released
by stressed or damaged cells.
{: #fs-id1976985}

These receptors, which are thought to have evolved prior to the adaptive
immune response, are present on the cell surface whether they are needed
or not. Their variety, however, is limited by two factors. First, the
fact that each receptor type must be encoded by a specific gene requires
the cell to allocate most or all of its DNA to make receptors able to
recognize all pathogens. Secondly, the variety of receptors is limited
by the finite surface area of the cell membrane. Thus, the innate immune
system must “get by” using only a limited number of receptors that are
active against as wide a variety of pathogens as possible. This strategy
is in stark contrast to the approach used by the adaptive immune system,
which uses large numbers of different receptors, each highly specific to
a particular pathogen.
{: #fs-id1962051}

Should the cells of the innate immune system come into contact with a
species of pathogen they recognize, the cell will bind to the pathogen
and initiate phagocytosis (or cellular apoptosis in the case of an
intracellular pathogen) in an effort to destroy the offending microbe.
Receptors vary somewhat according to cell type, but they usually include
receptors for bacterial components and for complement, discussed below.

# Soluble Mediators of the Innate Immune Response
{: data-type="title"}

The previous discussions have alluded to chemical signals that can
induce cells to change various physiological characteristics, such as
the expression of a particular receptor. These soluble factors are
secreted during innate or early induced responses, and later during
adaptive immune responses.

## Cytokines and Chemokines
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">cytokine</span> is signaling molecule that
allows cells to communicate with each other over short distances.
Cytokines are secreted into the intercellular space, and the action of
the cytokine induces the receiving cell to change its physiology. A
<span data-type="term">chemokine</span> is a soluble chemical mediator
similar to cytokines except that its function is to attract cells
(chemotaxis) from longer distances.

## Early induced Proteins
{: data-type="title"}

Early induced proteins are those that are not constitutively present in
the body, but are made as they are needed early during the innate immune
response. <span data-type="term">Interferons</span> are an example of
early induced proteins. Cells infected with viruses secrete interferons
that travel to adjacent cells and induce them to make antiviral
proteins. Thus, even though the initial cell is sacrificed, the
surrounding cells are protected. Other early induced proteins specific
for bacterial cell wall components are mannose-binding protein and
C-reactive protein, made in the liver, which bind specifically to
polysaccharide components of the bacterial cell wall. Phagocytes such as
macrophages have receptors for these proteins, and they are thus able to
recognize them as they are bound to the bacteria. This brings the
phagocyte and bacterium into close proximity and enhances the
phagocytosis of the bacterium by the process known as opsonization.
<span data-type="term">Opsonization</span> is the tagging of a pathogen
for phagocytosis by the binding of an antibody or an antimicrobial
protein.
{: #fs-id2760204}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1892003" markdown="1">
## Complement System
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">complement</span> system is a series of
proteins constitutively found in the blood plasma. As such, these
proteins are not considered part of the <span data-type="term">early
induced immune response</span>, even though they share features with
some of the antibacterial proteins of this class. Made in the liver,
they have a variety of functions in the innate immune response, using
what is known as the “alternate pathway” of complement activation.
Additionally, complement functions in the adaptive immune response as
well, in what is called the classical pathway. The complement system
consists of several proteins that enzymatically alter and fragment later
proteins in a series, which is why it is termed cascade. Once activated,
the series of reactions is irreversible, and releases fragments that
have the following actions:
{: #fs-id1648692}

* Bind to the cell membrane of the pathogen that activates it, labeling
  it for phagocytosis (opsonization)
* Diffuse away from the pathogen and act as chemotactic agents to
  attract phagocytic cells to the site of inflammation
* Form damaging pores in the plasma membrane of the pathogen
{: #fs-id2522955}

[\[link\]](#fig-ch22_02_02){: .autogenerated-content} shows the
classical pathway, which requires antibodies of the adaptive immune
response. The alternate pathway does not require an antibody to become
activated.
{: #fs-id1697494}

<figure id="fig-ch22_02_02">
<div data-type="title">
Complement Cascade and Function
</div>
<figcaption>
The classical pathway, used during adaptive immune responses, occurs
when C1 reacts with antibodies that have bound an antigen.
</figcaption>
<span markdown="1" data-type="media" id="fs-id2023458" data-alt="This flow chart

pathogen and the series of events that results in the complement cascade
and function.](../resources/2212_Complement_Cascade_and_Function.jpg){:
data-media-type="image/jpg" width="500"} </span>
</figure>
The splitting of the C3 protein is the common step to both pathways. In
the alternate pathway, C3 is activated spontaneously and, after reacting
with the molecules factor P, factor B, and factor D, splits apart. The
larger fragment, C3b, binds to the surface of the pathogen and C3a, the
smaller fragment, diffuses outward from the site of activation and
attracts phagocytes to the site of infection. Surface-bound C3b then
activates the rest of the cascade, with the last five proteins, C5–C9,
forming the membrane-attack complex (MAC). The MAC can kill certain
pathogens by disrupting their osmotic balance. The MAC is especially
effective against a broad range of bacteria. The classical pathway is
similar, except the early stages of activation require the presence of
antibody bound to antigen, and thus is dependent on the adaptive immune
response. The earlier fragments of the cascade also have important
functions. Phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils are
attracted to an infection site by chemotactic attraction to smaller
complement fragments. Additionally, once they arrive, their receptors
for surface-bound C3b opsonize the pathogen for phagocytosis and
destruction.

# Inflammatory Response
{: data-type="title"}

The hallmark of the innate immune response is <span
data-type="term">inflammation</span>. Inflammation is something everyone
has experienced. Stub a toe, cut a finger, or do any activity that
causes tissue damage and inflammation will result, with its four
characteristics: heat, redness, pain, and swelling (“loss of function”
is sometimes mentioned as a fifth characteristic). It is important to
note that inflammation does not have to be initiated by an infection,
but can also be caused by tissue injuries. The release of damaged
cellular contents into the site of injury is enough to stimulate the
response, even in the absence of breaks in physical barriers that would
allow pathogens to enter (by hitting your thumb with a hammer, for
example). The inflammatory reaction brings in phagocytic cells to the
damaged area to clear cellular debris and to set the stage for wound
repair ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1405901}

<figure id="fig-ch22_02_03">
<figcaption />
<span markdown="1" data-type="media" id="fs-id2161825" data-alt="The top panel of
this figure shows the mast cells detecting an injury and initiating an

data-media-type="image/jpg" width="350"} </span>
</figure>
This reaction also brings in the cells of the innate immune system,
allowing them to get rid of the sources of a possible infection.
Inflammation is part of a very basic form of immune response. The
process not only brings fluid and cells into the site to destroy the
pathogen and remove it and debris from the site, but also helps to
isolate the site, limiting the spread of the pathogen. <span
data-type="term">Acute inflammation</span> is a short-term inflammatory
response to an insult to the body. If the cause of the inflammation is
not resolved, however, it can lead to chronic inflammation, which is
associated with major tissue destruction and fibrosis. <span
data-type="term">Chronic inflammation</span> is ongoing inflammation. It
can be caused by foreign bodies, persistent pathogens, and autoimmune
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
{: #fs-id1968635}

There are four important parts to the inflammatory response:
{: #fs-id2238848}

* *Tissue Injury.*{: data-effect="italics"} The released contents of
  injured cells stimulate the release of <span data-type="term">mast
  cell</span> granules and their potent inflammatory mediators such as
  histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. <span
  data-type="term">Histamine</span> increases the diameter of local
  blood vessels (vasodilation), causing an increase in blood flow.
  Histamine also increases the permeability of local capillaries,
  causing plasma to leak out and form interstitial fluid. This causes
  the swelling associated with inflammation.
  <div data-type="newline" data-count="1">

  </div>

  Additionally, injured cells, phagocytes, and basophils are sources of
  inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
  Leukotrienes attract neutrophils from the blood by chemotaxis and
  increase vascular permeability. Prostaglandins cause vasodilation by
  relaxing vascular smooth muscle and are a major cause of the pain
  associated with inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
  such as aspirin and ibuprofen relieve pain by inhibiting prostaglandin
  production.
* *Vasodilation.*{: data-effect="italics"} Many inflammatory mediators
  such as histamine are vasodilators that increase the diameters of
  local capillaries. This causes increased blood flow and is responsible
  for the heat and redness of inflamed tissue. It allows greater access
  of the blood to the site of inflammation.
* *Increased Vascular Permeability.*{: data-effect="italics"} At the
  same time, inflammatory mediators increase the permeability of the
  local vasculature, causing leakage of fluid into the interstitial
  space, resulting in the swelling, or edema, associated with
  inflammation.
* *Recruitment of Phagocytes.*{: data-effect="italics"} Leukotrienes are
  particularly good at attracting neutrophils from the blood to the site
  of infection by chemotaxis. Following an early neutrophil infiltrate
  stimulated by macrophage cytokines, more macrophages are recruited to
  clean up the debris left over at the site. When local infections are
  severe, neutrophils are attracted to the sites of infections in large
  numbers, and as they phagocytose the pathogens and subsequently die,
  their accumulated cellular remains are visible as pus at the infection
  site.
{: #fs-id617021}

Overall, inflammation is valuable for many reasons. Not only are the
pathogens killed and debris removed, but the increase in vascular
permeability encourages the entry of clotting factors, the first step
towards wound repair. Inflammation also facilitates the transport of
antigen to lymph nodes by dendritic cells for the development of the
adaptive immune response.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Innate immune responses are critical to the early control of infections.
Whereas barrier defenses are the body’s first line of physical defense
against pathogens, innate immune responses are the first line of
physiological defense. Innate responses occur rapidly, but with less
specificity and effectiveness than the adaptive immune response. Innate
responses can be caused by a variety of cells, mediators, and
antibacterial proteins such as complement. Within the first few days of
an infection, another series of antibacterial proteins are induced, each
with activities against certain bacteria, including opsonization of
certain species. Additionally, interferons are induced that protect
cells from viruses in their vicinity. Finally, the innate immune
response does not stop when the adaptive immune response is developed.
In fact, both can cooperate and one can influence the other in their
responses against pathogens.
