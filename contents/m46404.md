Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart. Highly coordinated
contractions of cardiac muscle pump blood into the vessels of the
circulatory system. Similar to skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is
striated and organized into sarcomeres, possessing the same banding
organization as skeletal muscle ([\[link\]](#fig-ch10_07_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). However, cardiac muscle fibers are shorter
than skeletal muscle fibers and usually contain only one nucleus, which
is located in the central region of the cell. Cardiac muscle fibers also
possess many mitochondria and myoglobin, as ATP is produced primarily
through aerobic metabolism. Cardiac muscle fibers cells also are
extensively branched and are connected to one another at their ends by
intercalated discs. An <span data-type="term">intercalated disc</span>
allows the cardiac muscle cells to contract in a wave-like pattern so
that the heart can work as a pump.

Intercalated discs are part of the sarcolemma and contain two structures
important in cardiac muscle contraction: gap junctions and desmosomes. A
gap junction forms channels between adjacent cardiac muscle fibers that
allow the depolarizing current produced by cations to flow from one
cardiac muscle cell to the next. This joining is called electric
coupling, and in cardiac muscle it allows the quick transmission of
action potentials and the coordinated contraction of the entire heart.
This network of electrically connected cardiac muscle cells creates a
functional unit of contraction called a syncytium. The remainder of the
intercalated disc is composed of desmosomes. A <span
data-type="term">desmosome</span> is a cell structure that anchors the
ends of cardiac muscle fibers together so the cells do not pull apart
during the stress of individual fibers contracting
([\[link\]](#fig-ch10_07_02){: .autogenerated-content}).

Contractions of the heart (heartbeats) are controlled by specialized
cardiac muscle cells called pacemaker cells that directly control heart
rate. Although cardiac muscle cannot be consciously controlled, the
pacemaker cells respond to signals from the autonomic nervous system
(ANS) to speed up or slow down the heart rate. The pacemaker cells can
also respond to various hormones that modulate heart rate to control
blood pressure.
{: #fs-id1853723}

The wave of contraction that allows the heart to work as a unit, called
a functional syncytium, begins with the pacemaker cells. This group of
cells is self-excitable and able to depolarize to threshold and fire
action potentials on their own, a feature called <span
data-type="term">autorhythmicity</span>; they do this at set intervals
which determine heart rate. Because they are connected with gap
junctions to surrounding muscle fibers and the specialized fibers of the
heart’s conduction system, the pacemaker cells are able to transfer the
depolarization to the other cardiac muscle fibers in a manner that
allows the heart to contract in a coordinated manner.
{: #fs-id2254456}

Another feature of cardiac muscle is its relatively long action
potentials in its fibers, having a sustained depolarization “plateau.”
The plateau is produced by Ca<sup>++</sup> entry though voltage-gated
calcium channels in the sarcolemma of cardiac muscle fibers. This
sustained depolarization (and Ca<sup>++</sup> entry) provides for a
longer contraction than is produced by an action potential in skeletal
muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, a large percentage of the
Ca<sup>++</sup> that initiates contraction in cardiac muscles comes from
outside the cell rather than from the SR.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Cardiac muscle is striated muscle that is present only in the heart.
Cardiac muscle fibers have a single nucleus, are branched, and joined to
one another by intercalated discs that contain gap junctions for
depolarization between cells and desmosomes to hold the fibers together
when the heart contracts. Contraction in each cardiac muscle fiber is
triggered by Ca<sup>++</sup> ions in a similar manner as skeletal
muscle, but here the Ca<sup>++</sup> ions come from SR and through
voltage-gated calcium channels in the sarcolemma. Pacemaker cells
stimulate the spontaneous contraction of cardiac muscle as a functional
unit, called a syncytium.

An action potential could reach a cardiac muscle cell before it has
entered the relaxation phase, resulting in the sustained contractions of
tetanus. If this happened, the heart would not beat regularly.
