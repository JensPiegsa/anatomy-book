The integumentary system is susceptible to a variety of diseases,
disorders, and injuries. These range from annoying but relatively benign
bacterial or fungal infections that are categorized as disorders, to
skin cancer and severe burns, which can be fatal. In this section, you
will learn several of the most common skin conditions.

# Diseases
{: data-type="title"}

One of the most talked about diseases is skin cancer. Cancer is a broad
term that describes diseases caused by abnormal cells in the body
dividing uncontrollably. Most cancers are identified by the organ or
tissue in which the cancer originates. One common form of cancer is skin
cancer. The Skin Cancer Foundation reports that one in five Americans
will experience some type of skin cancer in their lifetime. The
degradation of the ozone layer in the atmosphere and the resulting
increase in exposure to UV radiation has contributed to its rise.
Overexposure to UV radiation damages DNA, which can lead to the
formation of cancerous lesions. Although melanin offers some protection
against DNA damage from the sun, often it is not enough. The fact that
cancers can also occur on areas of the body that are normally not
exposed to UV radiation suggests that there are additional factors that
can lead to cancerous lesions.
{: #fs-id1506076}

In general, cancers result from an accumulation of DNA mutations. These
mutations can result in cell populations that do not die when they
should and uncontrolled cell proliferation that leads to tumors.
Although many tumors are benign (harmless), some produce cells that can
mobilize and establish tumors in other organs of the body; this process
is referred to as <span data-type="term">metastasis</span>. Cancers are
characterized by their ability to metastasize.

## Basal Cell Carcinoma
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Basal cell carcinoma</span> is a form of cancer
that affects the mitotically active stem cells in the stratum basale of
the epidermis. It is the most common of all cancers that occur in the
United States and is frequently found on the head, neck, arms, and back,
which are areas that are most susceptible to long-term sun exposure.
Although UV rays are the main culprit, exposure to other agents, such as
radiation and arsenic, can also lead to this type of cancer. Wounds on
the skin due to open sores, tattoos, burns, etc. may be predisposing
factors as well. Basal cell carcinomas start in the stratum basale and
usually spread along this boundary. At some point, they begin to grow
toward the surface and become an uneven patch, bump, growth, or scar on
the skin surface ([\[link\]](#fig-ch05_04_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). Like most cancers, basal cell carcinomas
respond best to treatment when caught early. Treatment options include
surgery, freezing (cryosurgery), and topical ointments (Mayo Clinic
2012).

## Squamous Cell Carcinoma
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Squamous cell carcinoma</span> is a cancer that
affects the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum and presents as
lesions commonly found on the scalp, ears, and hands
([\[link\]](#fig-ch05_04_02){: .autogenerated-content}). It is the
second most common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society reports that
two of 10 skin cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, and it is more
aggressive than basal cell carcinoma. If not removed, these carcinomas
can metastasize. Surgery and radiation are used to cure squamous cell
carcinoma.

## Melanoma
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">melanoma</span> is a cancer characterized by
the uncontrolled growth of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in
the epidermis. Typically, a melanoma develops from a mole. It is the
most fatal of all skin cancers, as it is highly metastatic and can be
difficult to detect before it has spread to other organs. Melanomas
usually appear as asymmetrical brown and black patches with uneven
borders and a raised surface ([\[link\]](#fig-ch05_04_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). Treatment typically involves surgical excision
and immunotherapy.

Doctors often give their patients the following ABCDE mnemonic to help
with the diagnosis of early-stage melanoma. If you observe a mole on
your body displaying these signs, consult a doctor.

# Skin Disorders
{: data-type="title"}

Two common skin disorders are eczema and acne. Eczema is an inflammatory
condition and occurs in individuals of all ages. Acne involves the
clogging of pores, which can lead to infection and inflammation, and is
often seen in adolescents. Other disorders, not discussed here, include
seborrheic dermatitis (on the scalp), psoriasis, cold sores, impetigo,
scabies, hives, and warts.

## Eczema
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Eczema</span> is an allergic reaction that
manifests as dry, itchy patches of skin that resemble rashes
([\[link\]](#fig-ch05_04_04){: .autogenerated-content}). It may be
accompanied by swelling of the skin, flaking, and in severe cases,
bleeding. Many who suffer from eczema have antibodies against dust mites
in their blood, but the link between eczema and allergy to dust mites
has not been proven. Symptoms are usually managed with moisturizers,
corticosteroid creams, and immunosuppressants.

## Acne
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Acne</span> is a skin disturbance that typically
occurs on areas of the skin that are rich in sebaceous glands (face and
back). It is most common along with the onset of puberty due to
associated hormonal changes, but can also occur in infants and continue
into adulthood. Hormones, such as androgens, stimulate the release of
sebum. An overproduction and accumulation of sebum along with keratin
can block hair follicles. This plug is initially white. The sebum, when
oxidized by exposure to air, turns black. Acne results from infection by
acne-causing bacteria (*Propionibacterium*{: data-effect="italics"} and
*Staphylococcus*{: data-effect="italics"}), which can lead to redness
and potential scarring due to the natural wound healing process
([\[link\]](#fig-ch05_04_05){: .autogenerated-content}).

Career Connection
</div>
<span data-type="title">Dermatologist</span> Have you ever had a skin
rash that did not respond to over-the-counter creams, or a mole that you
were concerned about? Dermatologists help patients with these types of
problems and more, on a daily basis. Dermatologists are medical doctors
who specialize in diagnosing and treating skin disorders. Like all
medical doctors, dermatologists earn a medical degree and then complete
several years of residency training. In addition, dermatologists may
then participate in a dermatology fellowship or complete additional,
specialized training in a dermatology practice. If practicing in the
United States, dermatologists must pass the United States Medical
Licensing Exam (USMLE), become licensed in their state of practice, and
be certified by the American Board of Dermatology.
{: #fs-id1943991}

Most dermatologists work in a medical office or private-practice
setting. They diagnose skin conditions and rashes, prescribe oral and
topical medications to treat skin conditions, and may perform simple
procedures, such as mole or wart removal. In addition, they may refer
patients to an oncologist if skin cancer that has metastasized is
suspected. Recently, cosmetic procedures have also become a prominent
part of dermatology. Botox injections, laser treatments, and collagen
and dermal filler injections are popular among patients, hoping to
reduce the appearance of skin aging.
{: #fs-id1942514}

Dermatology is a competitive specialty in medicine. Limited openings in
dermatology residency programs mean that many medical students compete
for a few select spots. Dermatology is an appealing specialty to many
prospective doctors, because unlike emergency room physicians or
surgeons, dermatologists generally do not have to work excessive hours
or be “on-call” weekends and holidays. Moreover, the popularity of
cosmetic dermatology has made it a growing field with many lucrative
opportunities. It is not unusual for dermatology clinics to market
themselves exclusively as cosmetic dermatology centers, and for
dermatologists to specialize exclusively in these procedures.

the field and what the field of dermatology is like. Visit this

# Injuries
{: data-type="title"}

Because the skin is the part of our bodies that meets the world most
directly, it is especially vulnerable to injury. Injuries include burns
and wounds, as well as scars and calluses. They can be caused by sharp
objects, heat, or excessive pressure or friction to the skin.
{: #fs-id1534723}

Skin injuries set off a healing process that occurs in several
overlapping stages. The first step to repairing damaged skin is the
formation of a blood clot that helps stop the flow of blood and scabs
over with time. Many different types of cells are involved in wound
repair, especially if the surface area that needs repair is extensive.
Before the basal stem cells of the stratum basale can recreate the
epidermis, fibroblasts mobilize and divide rapidly to repair the damaged
tissue by collagen deposition, forming granulation tissue. Blood
capillaries follow the fibroblasts and help increase blood circulation
and oxygen supply to the area. Immune cells, such as macrophages, roam
the area and engulf any foreign matter to reduce the chance of
infection.
{: #fs-id1541614}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1942543" markdown="1">
## Burns
{: data-type="title"}

A burn results when the skin is damaged by intense heat, radiation,
electricity, or chemicals. The damage results in the death of skin
cells, which can lead to a massive loss of fluid. Dehydration,
electrolyte imbalance, and renal and circulatory failure follow, which
can be fatal. Burn patients are treated with intravenous fluids to
offset dehydration, as well as intravenous nutrients that enable the
body to repair tissues and replace lost proteins. Another serious threat
to the lives of burn patients is infection. Burned skin is extremely
susceptible to bacteria and other pathogens, due to the loss of
protection by intact layers of skin.
{: #fs-id1942548}

Burns are sometimes measured in terms of the size of the total surface
area affected. This is referred to as the “rule of nines,” which
associates specific anatomical areas with a percentage that is a factor
of nine ([\[link\]](#fig-ch05_04_06){: .autogenerated-content}). Burns
are also classified by the degree of their severity. A <span
data-type="term">first-degree burn</span> is a superficial burn that
affects only the epidermis. Although the skin may be painful and
swollen, these burns typically heal on their own within a few days. Mild
sunburn fits into the category of a first-degree burn. A <span
data-type="term">second-degree burn</span> goes deeper and affects both
the epidermis and a portion of the dermis. These burns result in
swelling and a painful blistering of the skin. It is important to keep
the burn site clean and sterile to prevent infection. If this is done,
the burn will heal within several weeks. A <span
data-type="term">third-degree burn</span> fully extends into the
epidermis and dermis, destroying the tissue and affecting the nerve
endings and sensory function. These are serious burns that may appear
white, red, or black; they require medical attention and will heal
slowly without it. A <span data-type="term">fourth-degree burn</span> is
even more severe, affecting the underlying muscle and bone. Oddly, third
and fourth-degree burns are usually not as painful because the nerve
endings themselves are damaged. Full-thickness burns cannot be repaired
by the body, because the local tissues used for repair are damaged and
require excision (debridement), or amputation in severe cases, followed
by grafting of the skin from an unaffected part of the body, or from
skin grown in tissue culture for grafting purposes.

## Scars and Keloids
{: data-type="title"}

Most cuts or wounds, with the exception of ones that only scratch the
surface (the epidermis), lead to scar formation. A <span
data-type="term">scar</span> is collagen-rich skin formed after the
process of wound healing that differs from normal skin. Scarring occurs
in cases in which there is repair of skin damage, but the skin fails to
regenerate the original skin structure. Fibroblasts generate scar tissue
in the form of collagen, and the bulk of repair is due to the
basket-weave pattern generated by collagen fibers and does not result in
regeneration of the typical cellular structure of skin. Instead, the
tissue is fibrous in nature and does not allow for the regeneration of
accessory structures, such as hair follicles, sweat glands, or sebaceous
glands.
{: #fs-id1942631}

Sometimes, there is an overproduction of scar tissue, because the
process of collagen formation does not stop when the wound is healed;
this results in the formation of a raised or hypertrophic scar called a
<span data-type="term">keloid</span>. In contrast, scars that result
from acne and chickenpox have a sunken appearance and are called
atrophic scars.
{: #fs-id1942644}

Scarring of skin after wound healing is a natural process and does not
need to be treated further. Application of mineral oil and lotions may
reduce the formation of scar tissue. However, modern cosmetic
procedures, such as dermabrasion, laser treatments, and filler
injections have been invented as remedies for severe scarring. All of
these procedures try to reorganize the structure of the epidermis and
underlying collagen tissue to make it look more natural.

## Bedsores and Stretch Marks
{: data-type="title"}

Skin and its underlying tissue can be affected by excessive pressure.
One example of this is called a <span data-type="term">bedsore</span>.
Bedsores, also called decubitis ulcers, are caused by constant,
long-term, unrelieved pressure on certain body parts that are bony,
reducing blood flow to the area and leading to necrosis (tissue death).
Bedsores are most common in elderly patients who have debilitating
conditions that cause them to be immobile. Most hospitals and long-term
care facilities have the practice of turning the patients every few
hours to prevent the incidence of bedsores. If left untreated by removal
of necrotized tissue, bedsores can be fatal if they become infected.
{: #fs-id1942665}

The skin can also be affected by pressure associated with rapid growth.
A <span data-type="term">stretch mark</span> results when the dermis is
stretched beyond its limits of elasticity, as the skin stretches to
accommodate the excess pressure. Stretch marks usually accompany rapid
weight gain during puberty and pregnancy. They initially have a reddish
hue, but lighten over time. Other than for cosmetic reasons, treatment
of stretch marks is not required. They occur most commonly over the hips
and abdomen.

## Calluses
{: data-type="title"}

When you wear shoes that do not fit well and are a constant source of
abrasion on your toes, you tend to form a <span
data-type="term">callus</span> at the point of contact. This occurs
because the basal stem cells in the stratum basale are triggered to
divide more often to increase the thickness of the skin at the point of
abrasion to protect the rest of the body from further damage. This is an
example of a minor or local injury, and the skin manages to react and
treat the problem independent of the rest of the body. Calluses can also
form on your fingers if they are subject to constant mechanical stress,
such as long periods of writing, playing string instruments, or video
games. A <span data-type="term">corn</span> is a specialized form of
callus. Corns form from abrasions on the skin that result from an
elliptical-type motion.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Skin cancer is a result of damage to the DNA of skin cells, often due to
excessive exposure to UV radiation. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous
cell carcinoma are highly curable, and arise from cells in the stratum
basale and stratum spinosum, respectively. Melanoma is the most
dangerous form of skin cancer, affecting melanocytes, which can
spread/metastasize to other organs. Burns are an injury to the skin that
occur as a result of exposure to extreme heat, radiation, or chemicals.
First-degree and second-degree burns usually heal quickly, but
third-degree burns can be fatal because they penetrate the full
thickness of the skin. Scars occur when there is repair of skin damage.
Fibroblasts generate scar tissue in the form of collagen, which forms a
basket-weave pattern that looks different from normal skin.
{: #fs-id1942717}

Bedsores and stretch marks are the result of excessive pressure on the
skin and underlying tissue. Bedsores are characterized by necrosis of
tissue due to immobility, whereas stretch marks result from rapid
growth. Eczema is an allergic reaction that manifests as a rash, and
acne results from clogged sebaceous glands. Eczema and acne are usually
long-term skin conditions that may be treated successfully in mild
cases. Calluses and corns are the result of abrasive pressure on the
skin.

Why do teenagers often experience acne?
{: #fs-id1265514}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1739775" data-label="" markdown="1">
Acne results from a blockage of sebaceous glands by sebum. The blockage
causes blackheads to form, which are susceptible to infection. The
infected tissue then becomes red and inflamed. Teenagers experience this
at high rates because the sebaceous glands become active during puberty.
Hormones that are especially active during puberty stimulate the release
of sebum, leading in many cases to blockages.

Why do scars look different from surrounding skin?
{: #fs-id1959996}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1960000" data-label="" markdown="1">
Scars are made of collagen and do not have the cellular structure of
normal skin. The tissue is fibrous and does not allow for the
regeneration of accessory structures, such as hair follicles, and sweat
or sebaceous glands.
