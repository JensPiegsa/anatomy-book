* Describe the structural features of cartilaginous joints
* Distinguish between a synchondrosis and symphysis
* Give an example of each type of cartilaginous joint

As the name indicates, at a cartilaginous joint, the adjacent bones are
united by cartilage, a tough but flexible type of connective tissue.
These types of joints lack a joint cavity and involve bones that are
joined together by either hyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage
([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_03_01){: .autogenerated-content}). There are two
types of cartilaginous joints. A synchondrosis is a cartilaginous joint
where the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Also classified as a
synchondrosis are places where bone is united to a cartilage structure,
such as between the anterior end of a rib and the costal cartilage of
the thoracic cage. The second type of cartilaginous joint is a
symphysis, where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage.

At cartilaginous joints, bones are united by hyaline cartilage to form a
synchondrosis or by fibrocartilage to form a symphysis. (a) The hyaline
cartilage of the epiphyseal plate (growth plate) forms a synchondrosis
that unites the shaft (diaphysis) and end (epiphysis) of a long bone and
allows the bone to grow in length. (b) The pubic portions of the right
and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage,
forming the pubic symphysis.

# Synchondrosis
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">synchondrosis</span> (“joined by cartilage”) is
a cartilaginous joint where bones are joined together by hyaline
cartilage, or where bone is united to hyaline cartilage. A synchondrosis
may be temporary or permanent. A temporary synchondrosis is the
epiphyseal plate (growth plate) of a growing long bone. The epiphyseal
plate is the region of growing hyaline cartilage that unites the
diaphysis (shaft) of the bone to the epiphysis (end of the bone). Bone
lengthening involves growth of the epiphyseal plate cartilage and its
replacement by bone, which adds to the diaphysis. For many years during
childhood growth, the rates of cartilage growth and bone formation are
equal and thus the epiphyseal plate does not change in overall thickness
as the bone lengthens. During the late teens and early 20s, growth of
the cartilage slows and eventually stops. The epiphyseal plate is then
completely replaced by bone, and the diaphysis and epiphysis portions of
the bone fuse together to form a single adult bone. This fusion of the
diaphysis and epiphysis is a synostosis. Once this occurs, bone
lengthening ceases. For this reason, the epiphyseal plate is considered
to be a temporary synchondrosis. Because cartilage is softer than bone
tissue, injury to a growing long bone can damage the epiphyseal plate
cartilage, thus stopping bone growth and preventing additional bone
lengthening.

Growing layers of cartilage also form synchondroses that join together
the ilium, ischium, and pubic portions of the hip bone during childhood
and adolescence. When body growth stops, the cartilage disappears and is
replaced by bone, forming synostoses and fusing the bony components
together into the single hip bone of the adult. Similarly, synostoses
unite the sacral vertebrae that fuse together to form the adult sacrum.

Visit this [website][1] to view a radiograph (X-ray image) of a child’s
hand and wrist. The growing bones of child have an epiphyseal plate that
forms a synchondrosis between the shaft and end of a long bone. Being
less dense than bone, the area of epiphyseal cartilage is seen on this
radiograph as the dark epiphyseal gaps located near the ends of the long
bones, including the radius, ulna, metacarpal, and phalanx bones. Which
of the bones in this image do not show an epiphyseal plate (epiphyseal
gap)?

Examples of permanent synchondroses are found in the thoracic cage. One
example is the first sternocostal joint, where the first rib is anchored
to the manubrium by its costal cartilage. (The articulations of the
remaining costal cartilages to the sternum are all synovial joints.)
Additional synchondroses are formed where the anterior end of the other
11 ribs is joined to its costal cartilage. Unlike the temporary
synchondroses of the epiphyseal plate, these permanent synchondroses
retain their hyaline cartilage and thus do not ossify with age. Due to
the lack of movement between the bone and cartilage, both temporary and
permanent synchondroses are functionally classified as a synarthrosis.

# Symphysis
{: data-type="title"}

A cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage is
called a <span data-type="term">symphysis</span> (“growing together”).
Fibrocartilage is very strong because it contains numerous bundles of
thick collagen fibers, thus giving it a much greater ability to resist
pulling and bending forces when compared with hyaline cartilage. This
gives symphyses the ability to strongly unite the adjacent bones, but
can still allow for limited movement to occur. Thus, a symphysis is
functionally classified as an amphiarthrosis.
{: #fs-id1837923}

The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide.
Examples in which the gap between the bones is narrow include the pubic
symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the
pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined
together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap. Similarly, at the
manubriosternal joint, fibrocartilage unites the manubrium and body
portions of the sternum.
{: #fs-id2379304}

The intervertebral symphysis is a wide symphysis located between the
bodies of adjacent vertebrae of the vertebral column. Here a thick pad
of fibrocartilage called an intervertebral disc strongly unites the
adjacent vertebrae by filling the gap between them. The width of the
intervertebral symphysis is important because it allows for small
movements between the adjacent vertebrae. In addition, the thick
intervertebral disc provides cushioning between the vertebrae, which is
important when carrying heavy objects or during high-impact activities
such as running or jumping.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

There are two types of cartilaginous joints. A synchondrosis is formed
when the adjacent bones are united by hyaline cartilage. A temporary
synchondrosis is formed by the epiphyseal plate of a growing long bone,
which is lost when the epiphyseal plate ossifies as the bone reaches
maturity. The synchondrosis is thus replaced by a synostosis. Permanent
synchondroses that do not ossify are found at the first sternocostal
joint and between the anterior ends of the bony ribs and the junction
with their costal cartilage. A symphysis is where the bones are joined
by fibrocartilage and the gap between the bones may be narrow or wide. A
narrow symphysis is found at the manubriosternal joint and at the pubic
symphysis. A wide symphysis is the intervertebral symphysis in which the
bodies of adjacent vertebrae are united by an intervertebral disc.

Although they are still growing, the carpal bones of the wrist area do
not show an epiphyseal plate. Instead of elongating, these bones grow in
diameter by adding new bone to their surfaces.

Cartilaginous joints are where the adjacent bones are joined by
cartilage. At a synchondrosis, the bones are united by hyaline
cartilage. The epiphyseal plate of growing long bones and the first
sternocostal joint that unites the first rib to the sternum are examples
of synchondroses. At a symphysis, the bones are joined by
fibrocartilage, which is strong and flexible. Symphysis joints include
the intervertebral symphysis between adjacent vertebrae and the pubic
symphysis that joins the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones.

The first sternocostal joint is a synchondrosis type of cartilaginous
joint in which hyaline cartilage unites the first rib to the manubrium
of the sternum. This forms an immobile (synarthrosis) type of joint. The
pubic symphysis is a slightly mobile (amphiarthrosis) cartilaginous
joint, where the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones are
united by fibrocartilage, thus forming a symphysis.
