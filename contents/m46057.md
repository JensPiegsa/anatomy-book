Nervous tissue is characterized as being excitable and capable of
sending and receiving electrochemical signals that provide the body with
information. Two main classes of cells make up nervous tissue: the <span
data-type="term">neuron</span> and <span
data-type="term">neuroglia</span> ([\[link\]](#fig-ch04_05_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). Neurons propagate information via
electrochemical impulses, called action potentials, which are
biochemically linked to the release of chemical signals. Neuroglia play
an essential role in supporting neurons and modulating their information
propagation.

The Neuron

The cell body of a neuron, also called the soma, contains the nucleus
and mitochondria. The dendrites transfer the nerve impulse to the soma.
The axon carries the action potential away to another excitable cell. LM

Neurons display distinctive morphology, well suited to their role as
conducting cells, with three main parts. The cell body includes most of
the cytoplasm, the organelles, and the nucleus. Dendrites branch off the
cell body and appear as thin extensions. A long “tail,” the axon,
extends from the neuron body and can be wrapped in an insulating layer
known as <span data-type="term">myelin</span>, which is formed by
accessory cells. The synapse is the gap between nerve cells, or between
a nerve cell and its target, for example, a muscle or a gland, across
which the impulse is transmitted by chemical compounds known as
neurotransmitters. Neurons categorized as multipolar neurons have
several dendrites and a single prominent axon. Bipolar neurons possess a
single dendrite and axon with the cell body, while unipolar neurons have
only a single process extending out from the cell body, which divides
into a functional dendrite and into a functional axon. When a neuron is
sufficiently stimulated, it generates an action potential that
propagates down the axon towards the synapse. If enough
neurotransmitters are released at the synapse to stimulate the next
neuron or target, a response is generated.

The second class of neural cells comprises the neuroglia or glial cells,
which have been characterized as having a simple support role. The word
“glia” comes from the Greek word for glue. Recent research is shedding
light on the more complex role of neuroglia in the function of the brain
and nervous system. <span data-type="term">Astrocyte</span> cells, named
for their distinctive star shape, are abundant in the central nervous
system. The astrocytes have many functions, including regulation of ion
concentration in the intercellular space, uptake and/or breakdown of
some neurotransmitters, and formation of the blood-brain barrier, the
membrane that separates the circulatory system from the brain. Microglia
protect the nervous system against infection but are not nervous tissue
because they are related to macrophages. <span
data-type="term">Oligodendrocyte</span> cells produce myelin in the
central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) while the <span
data-type="term">Schwann cell</span> produces myelin in the peripheral
nervous system ([\[link\]](#fig-ch04_05_02){: .autogenerated-content}).

equally spaced segments along the axon. Another cell, called an
oligodendrocyte, is spider like in appearance, with its leg-like

sheath. Above the neuron are three astrocytes. They are much smaller
than the neuron and have no axons, and are also irregularly shaped cells

microglial cell is shown above the neuron. It is the smallest of the

tentacle-like projections. The projections are concentrated at the two
ends of the cell, with the middle area lacking any projections. The
micrograph of the neural tissue shows that this tissue is very
heterogenous, with both large and small cells embedded in the matrix.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The most prominent cell of the nervous tissue, the neuron, is
characterized mainly by its ability to receive stimuli and respond by
generating an electrical signal, known as an action potential, which can
travel rapidly over great distances in the body. A typical neuron
displays a distinctive morphology: a large cell body branches out into
short extensions called dendrites, which receive chemical signals from
other neurons, and a long tail called an axon, which relays signals away
from the cell to other neurons, muscles, or glands. Many axons are
wrapped by a myelin sheath, a lipid derivative that acts as an insulator
and speeds up the transmission of the action potential. Other cells in
the nervous tissue, the neuroglia, include the astrocytes, microglia,
oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells.
