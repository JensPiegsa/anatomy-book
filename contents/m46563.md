The <span data-type="term">immune system</span> is the complex
collection of cells and organs that destroys or neutralizes pathogens
that would otherwise cause disease or death. The lymphatic system, for
most people, is associated with the immune system to such a degree that
the two systems are virtually indistinguishable. The <span
data-type="term">lymphatic system</span> is the system of vessels,
cells, and organs that carries excess fluids to the bloodstream and
filters pathogens from the blood. The swelling of lymph nodes during an
infection and the transport of lymphocytes via the lymphatic vessels are
but two examples of the many connections between these critical organ
systems.

# Functions of the Lymphatic System
{: data-type="title"}

A major function of the lymphatic system is to drain body fluids and
return them to the bloodstream. Blood pressure causes leakage of fluid
from the capillaries, resulting in the accumulation of fluid in the
interstitial space—that is, spaces between individual cells in the
tissues. In humans, 20 liters of plasma is released into the
interstitial space of the tissues each day due to capillary filtration.
Once this filtrate is out of the bloodstream and in the tissue spaces,
it is referred to as interstitial fluid. Of this, 17 liters is
reabsorbed directly by the blood vessels. But what happens to the
remaining three liters? This is where the lymphatic system comes into
play. It drains the excess fluid and empties it back into the
bloodstream via a series of vessels, trunks, and ducts. <span
data-type="term">Lymph</span> is the term used to describe interstitial
fluid once it has entered the lymphatic system. When the lymphatic
system is damaged in some way, such as by being blocked by cancer cells
or destroyed by injury, protein-rich interstitial fluid accumulates
(sometimes “backs up” from the lymph vessels) in the tissue spaces. This
inappropriate accumulation of fluid referred to as lymphedema may lead
to serious medical consequences.
{: #fs-id2017236}

As the vertebrate immune system evolved, the network of lymphatic
vessels became convenient avenues for transporting the cells of the
immune system. Additionally, the transport of dietary lipids and
fat-soluble vitamins absorbed in the gut uses this system.
{: #fs-id2578407}

Cells of the immune system not only use lymphatic vessels to make their
way from interstitial spaces back into the circulation, but they also
use lymph nodes as major staging areas for the development of critical
immune responses. A <span data-type="term">lymph node</span> is one of
the small, bean-shaped organs located throughout the lymphatic system.

# Structure of the Lymphatic System
{: data-type="title"}

The lymphatic vessels begin as open-ended capillaries, which feed into
larger and larger lymphatic vessels, and eventually empty into the
bloodstream by a series of ducts. Along the way, the lymph travels
through the lymph nodes, which are commonly found near the groin,
armpits, neck, chest, and abdomen. Humans have about 500–600 lymph nodes
throughout the body ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_01){:
.autogenerated-content}).

</figure>
A major distinction between the lymphatic and cardiovascular systems in
humans is that lymph is not actively pumped by the heart, but is forced
through the vessels by the movements of the body, the contraction of
skeletal muscles during body movements, and breathing. One-way valves
(semi-lunar valves) in lymphatic vessels keep the lymph moving toward
the heart. Lymph flows from the lymphatic capillaries, through lymphatic
vessels, and then is dumped into the circulatory system via the
lymphatic ducts located at the junction of the jugular and subclavian
veins in the neck.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2621737" markdown="1">
## Lymphatic Capillaries
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Lymphatic capillaries</span>, also called the
terminal lymphatics, are vessels where interstitial fluid enters the
lymphatic system to become lymph fluid. Located in almost every tissue
in the body, these vessels are interlaced among the arterioles and
venules of the circulatory system in the soft connective tissues of the
body ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_02){: .autogenerated-content}). Exceptions
are the central nervous system, bone marrow, bones, teeth, and the
cornea of the eye, which do not contain lymph vessels.

Lymphatic capillaries are interlaced with the arterioles and venules of
the cardiovascular system. Collagen fibers anchor a lymphatic capillary
in the tissue (inset). Interstitial fluid slips through spaces between
the overlapping endothelial cells that compose the lymphatic capillary.

</figure>
Lymphatic capillaries are formed by a one cell-thick layer of
endothelial cells and represent the open end of the system, allowing
interstitial fluid to flow into them via overlapping cells (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_02){: .autogenerated-content}). When
interstitial pressure is low, the endothelial flaps close to prevent
“backflow.” As interstitial pressure increases, the spaces between the
cells open up, allowing the fluid to enter. Entry of fluid into
lymphatic capillaries is also enabled by the collagen filaments that
anchor the capillaries to surrounding structures. As interstitial
pressure increases, the filaments pull on the endothelial cell flaps,
opening up them even further to allow easy entry of fluid.
{: #fs-id2052272}

In the small intestine, lymphatic capillaries called lacteals are
critical for the transport of dietary lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins
to the bloodstream. In the small intestine, dietary triglycerides
combine with other lipids and proteins, and enter the lacteals to form a
milky fluid called <span data-type="term">chyle</span>. The chyle then
travels through the lymphatic system, eventually entering the liver and
then the bloodstream.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2101836" markdown="1">
## Larger Lymphatic Vessels, Trunks, and Ducts
{: data-type="title"}

The lymphatic capillaries empty into larger lymphatic vessels, which are
similar to veins in terms of their three-tunic structure and the
presence of valves. These one-way valves are located fairly close to one
another, and each one causes a bulge in the lymphatic vessel, giving the
vessels a beaded appearance (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_02){:
.autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1928398}

The superficial and deep lymphatics eventually merge to form larger
lymphatic vessels known as <span data-type="term">lymphatic
trunks</span>. On the right side of the body, the right sides of the
head, thorax, and right upper limb drain lymph fluid into the right
subclavian vein via the right lymphatic duct
([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_03){: .autogenerated-content}). On the left
side of the body, the remaining portions of the body drain into the
larger thoracic duct, which drains into the left subclavian vein. The
thoracic duct itself begins just beneath the diaphragm in the <span
data-type="term">cisterna chyli</span>, a sac-like chamber that receives
lymph from the lower abdomen, pelvis, and lower limbs by way of the left
and right lumbar trunks and the intestinal trunk.

enters the bloodstream through the <span data-type="term">thoracic

lymphatic vessels of the subcutaneous tissues of the skin, that is, the
superficial lymphatics, follow the same routes as veins, whereas the
deep lymphatic vessels of the viscera generally follow the paths of
arteries.

# The Organization of Immune Function
{: data-type="title"}

The immune system is a collection of barriers, cells, and soluble
proteins that interact and communicate with each other in
extraordinarily complex ways. The modern model of immune function is
organized into three phases based on the timing of their effects. The
three temporal phases consist of the following:
{: #fs-id1636676}

* <span data-type="term">Barrier defenses</span> such as the skin and
  mucous membranes, which act instantaneously to prevent pathogenic
  invasion into the body tissues
* The rapid but nonspecific <span data-type="term">innate immune
  response</span>, which consists of a variety of specialized cells and
  soluble factors
* The slower but more specific and effective <span
  data-type="term">adaptive immune response</span>, which involves many
  cell types and soluble factors, but is primarily controlled by white
  blood cells (leukocytes) known as <span
  data-type="term">lymphocytes</span>, which help control immune
  responses
{: #fs-id1534524}

The cells of the blood, including all those involved in the immune
response, arise in the bone marrow via various differentiation pathways
from hematopoietic stem cells ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_04){:
.autogenerated-content}). In contrast with embryonic stem cells,
hematopoietic stem cells are present throughout adulthood and allow for
the continuous differentiation of blood cells to replace those lost to
age or function. These cells can be divided into three classes based on
function:
{: #fs-id1350098}

* Phagocytic cells, which ingest pathogens to destroy them
* Lymphocytes, which specifically coordinate the activities of adaptive
  immunity
* Cells containing cytoplasmic granules, which help mediate immune
  responses against parasites and intracellular pathogens such as
  viruses

# Lymphocytes: B Cells, T Cells, Plasma Cells, and Natural Killer Cells
{: data-type="title"}

As stated above, lymphocytes are the primary cells of adaptive immune
responses ([\[link\]](#tbl-ch22_01){: .autogenerated-content}). The two
basic types of lymphocytes, B cells and T cells, are identical
morphologically with a large central nucleus surrounded by a thin layer
of cytoplasm. They are distinguished from each other by their surface
protein markers as well as by the molecules they secrete. While B cells
mature in red bone marrow and T cells mature in the thymus, they both
initially develop from bone marrow. T cells migrate from bone marrow to
the thymus gland where they further mature. B cells and T cells are
found in many parts of the body, circulating in the bloodstream and
lymph, and residing in secondary lymphoid organs, including the spleen
and lymph nodes, which will be described later in this section. The
human body contains approximately 10<sup>12</sup> lymphocytes.
{: #fs-id1416789}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2242180" markdown="1">
## B Cells
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">B cells</span> are immune cells that function
primarily by producing antibodies. An <span
data-type="term">antibody</span> is any of the group of proteins that
binds specifically to pathogen-associated molecules known as antigens.
An <span data-type="term">antigen</span> is a chemical structure on the
surface of a pathogen that binds to T or B lymphocyte antigen receptors.
Once activated by binding to antigen, B cells differentiate into cells
that secrete a soluble form of their surface antibodies. These activated
B cells are known as plasma cells.
{: #fs-id1422418}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2239798" markdown="1">
## T Cells
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">T cell</span>, on the other hand, does not
secrete antibody but performs a variety of functions in the adaptive
immune response. Different T cell types have the ability to either
secrete soluble factors that communicate with other cells of the
adaptive immune response or destroy cells infected with intracellular
pathogens. The roles of T and B lymphocytes in the adaptive immune
response will be discussed further in this chapter.
{: #fs-id1978271}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2237327" markdown="1">
## Plasma Cells
{: data-type="title"}

Another type of lymphocyte of importance is the plasma cell. A <span
data-type="term">plasma cell</span> is a B cell that has differentiated
in response to antigen binding, and has thereby gained the ability to
secrete soluble antibodies. These cells differ in morphology from
standard B and T cells in that they contain a large amount of cytoplasm
packed with the protein-synthesizing machinery known as rough
endoplasmic reticulum.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2044858" markdown="1">
## Natural Killer Cells
{: data-type="title"}

A fourth important lymphocyte is the natural killer cell, a participant
in the innate immune response. A <span data-type="term">natural killer
cell (NK)</span> is a circulating blood cell that contains cytotoxic
(cell-killing) granules in its extensive cytoplasm. It shares this
mechanism with the cytotoxic T cells of the adaptive immune response. NK
cells are among the body’s first lines of defense against viruses and
certain types of cancer.

# Primary Lymphoid Organs and Lymphocyte Development
{: data-type="title"}

Understanding the differentiation and development of B and T cells is
critical to the understanding of the adaptive immune response. It is
through this process that the body (ideally) learns to destroy only
pathogens and leaves the body’s own cells relatively intact. The <span
data-type="term">primary lymphoid organs</span> are the bone marrow,
spleen, and thymus gland. The lymphoid organs are where lymphocytes
mature, proliferate, and are selected, which enables them to attack
pathogens without harming the cells of the body.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1321962" markdown="1">
## Bone Marrow
{: data-type="title"}

In the embryo, blood cells are made in the yolk sac. As development
proceeds, this function is taken over by the spleen, lymph nodes, and
liver. Later, the bone marrow takes over most hematopoietic functions,
although the final stages of the differentiation of some cells may take
place in other organs. The red <span data-type="term">bone marrow</span>
is a loose collection of cells where hematopoiesis occurs, and the
yellow bone marrow is a site of energy storage, which consists largely
of fat cells ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_05){: .autogenerated-content}).
The B cell undergoes nearly all of its development in the red bone
marrow, whereas the immature T cell, called a <span

largely in the thymus gland.

The connective tissue capsule further divides the thymus into lobules
via extensions called trabeculae. The outer region of the organ is known
as the cortex and contains large numbers of thymocytes with some
epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (two types of
phagocytic cells that are derived from monocytes). The cortex is densely
packed so it stains more intensely than the rest of the thymus (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_06){: .autogenerated-content}). The medulla,
where thymocytes migrate before leaving the thymus, contains a less
dense collection of thymocytes, epithelial cells, and dendritic cells.

<div data-type="title">
Aging and the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Immune System</span> By the year 2050, 25
percent of the population of the United States will be 60 years of age
or older. The CDC estimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older
have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the
immune systems. This loss of immune function with age is called
immunosenescence. To treat this growing population, medical
professionals must better understand the aging process. One major cause
of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic involution, the shrinking
of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three
percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35–45 years of age,
when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest
of one’s life. At that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue
and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. Thus, this age is
a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan.
{: #fs-id2176174}

Thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have
a thymus gland. Animal studies have shown that transplanted thymic
grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of
the donor and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically
programmed. There is evidence that the thymic microenvironment, so vital
to the development of naïve T cells, loses thymic epithelial cells
according to the decreasing expression of the FOXN1 gene with age.
{: #fs-id2070568}

It is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone
levels. Sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone enhance
involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary
thymic involution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and
its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases.
What does all this tell us? Can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least
slow it down? The potential is there for using thymic transplants from
younger donors to keep thymic output of naïve T cells high. Gene
therapies that target gene expression are also seen as future
possibilities. The more we learn through immunosenescence research, the
more opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these
therapies will likely take decades to develop. The ultimate goal is for
everyone to live and be healthy longer, but there may be limits to
immortality imposed by our genes and hormones.

# Secondary Lymphoid Organs and their Roles in Active Immune Responses
{: data-type="title"}

Lymphocytes develop and mature in the primary lymphoid organs, but they
mount immune responses from the <span data-type="term">secondary
lymphoid organs</span>. A <span data-type="term">naïve lymphocyte</span>
is one that has left the primary organ and entered a secondary lymphoid
organ. Naïve lymphocytes are fully functional immunologically, but have
yet to encounter an antigen to respond to. In addition to circulating in
the blood and lymph, lymphocytes concentrate in secondary lymphoid
organs, which include the lymph nodes, spleen, and lymphoid nodules. All
of these tissues have many features in common, including the following:
{: #fs-id1917781}

* The presence of lymphoid follicles, the sites of the formation of
  lymphocytes, with specific B cell-rich and T cell-rich areas
* An internal structure of reticular fibers with associated fixed
  macrophages
* <span data-type="term">Germinal centers</span>, which are the sites of

* Specialized post-capillary vessels known as <span

## Lymph Nodes
{: data-type="title"}

Lymph nodes function to remove debris and pathogens from the lymph, and
are thus sometimes referred to as the “filters of the lymph”
([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_07){: .autogenerated-content}). Any bacteria
that infect the interstitial fluid are taken up by the lymphatic
capillaries and transported to a regional lymph node. Dendritic cells
and macrophages within this organ internalize and kill many of the
pathogens that pass through, thereby removing them from the body. The
lymph node is also the site of adaptive immune responses mediated by T
cells, B cells, and accessory cells of the adaptive immune system. Like
the thymus, the bean-shaped lymph nodes are surrounded by a tough
capsule of connective tissue and are separated into compartments by
trabeculae, the extensions of the capsule. In addition to the structure
provided by the capsule and trabeculae, the structural support of the
lymph node is provided by a series of reticular fibers laid down by
fibroblasts.

The major routes into the lymph node are via <span
data-type="term">afferent lymphatic vessels</span> (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_07){: .autogenerated-content}). Cells and lymph
fluid that leave the lymph node may do so by another set of vessels
known as the <span data-type="term">efferent lymphatic vessels</span>.
Lymph enters the lymph node via the subcapsular sinus, which is occupied
by dendritic cells, macrophages, and reticular fibers. Within the cortex
of the lymph node are lymphoid follicles, which consist of germinal
centers of rapidly dividing B cells surrounded by a layer of T cells and
other accessory cells. As the lymph continues to flow through the node,
it enters the medulla, which consists of medullary cords of B cells and
plasma cells, and the medullary sinuses where the lymph collects before
leaving the node via the efferent lymphatic vessels.

## Spleen
{: data-type="title"}

In addition to the lymph nodes, the <span data-type="term">spleen</span>
is a major secondary lymphoid organ ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_08){:
.autogenerated-content}). It is about 12 cm (5 in) long and is attached
to the lateral border of the stomach via the gastrosplenic ligament. The
spleen is a fragile organ without a strong capsule, and is dark red due
to its extensive vascularization. The spleen is sometimes called the
“filter of the blood” because of its extensive vascularization and the
presence of macrophages and dendritic cells that remove microbes and
other materials from the blood, including dying red blood cells. The
spleen also functions as the location of immune responses to blood-borne
pathogens.

</figure>
The spleen is also divided by trabeculae of connective tissue, and
within each splenic nodule is an area of red pulp, consisting of mostly
red blood cells, and white pulp, which resembles the lymphoid follicles
of the lymph nodes. Upon entering the spleen, the splenic artery splits
into several arterioles (surrounded by white pulp) and eventually into
sinusoids. Blood from the capillaries subsequently collects in the
venous sinuses and leaves via the splenic vein. The red pulp consists of
reticular fibers with fixed macrophages attached, free macrophages, and
all of the other cells typical of the blood, including some lymphocytes.
The white pulp surrounds a central arteriole and consists of germinal
centers of dividing B cells surrounded by T cells and accessory cells,
including macrophages and dendritic cells. Thus, the red pulp primarily
functions as a filtration system of the blood, using cells of the
relatively nonspecific immune response, and white pulp is where adaptive
T and B cell responses are mounted.

## Lymphoid Nodules
{: data-type="title"}

The other lymphoid tissues, the <span data-type="term">lymphoid
nodules</span>, have a simpler architecture than the spleen and lymph
nodes in that they consist of a dense cluster of lymphocytes without a
surrounding fibrous capsule. These nodules are located in the
respiratory and digestive tracts, areas routinely exposed to
environmental pathogens.
{: #fs-id1395191}

<span data-type="term">Tonsils</span> are lymphoid nodules located along
the inner surface of the pharynx and are important in developing
immunity to oral pathogens ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_09){:
.autogenerated-content}). The tonsil located at the back of the throat,
the pharyngeal tonsil, is sometimes referred to as the adenoid when
swollen. Such swelling is an indication of an active immune response to
infection. Histologically, tonsils do not contain a complete capsule,
and the epithelial layer invaginates deeply into the interior of the
tonsil to form tonsillar crypts. These structures, which accumulate all
sorts of materials taken into the body through eating and breathing,
actually “encourage” pathogens to penetrate deep into the tonsillar
tissues where they are acted upon by numerous lymphoid follicles and
eliminated. This seems to be the major function of tonsils—to help
children’s bodies recognize, destroy, and develop immunity to common
environmental pathogens so that they will be protected in their later
lives. Tonsils are often removed in those children who have recurring
throat infections, especially those involving the palatine tonsils on
either side of the throat, whose swelling may interfere with their
breathing and/or swallowing.

<span data-type="term">Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)</span>
consists of an aggregate of lymphoid follicles directly associated with
the mucous membrane epithelia. MALT makes up dome-shaped structures
found underlying the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, breast
tissue, lungs, and eyes. Peyer’s patches, a type of MALT in the small
intestine, are especially important for immune responses against
ingested substances ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_01_10){:
.autogenerated-content}). Peyer’s patches contain specialized
endothelial cells called M (or microfold) cells that sample material
from the intestinal lumen and transport it to nearby follicles so that
adaptive immune responses to potential pathogens can be mounted.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The lymphatic system is a series of vessels, ducts, and trunks that
remove interstitial fluid from the tissues and return it the blood. The
lymphatics are also used to transport dietary lipids and cells of the
immune system. Cells of the immune system all come from the
hematopoietic system of the bone marrow. Primary lymphoid organs, the
bone marrow and thymus gland, are the locations where lymphocytes of the
adaptive immune system proliferate and mature. Secondary lymphoid organs
are site in which mature lymphocytes congregate to mount immune
responses. Many immune system cells use the lymphatic and circulatory
systems for transport throughout the body to search for and then protect
against pathogens.
