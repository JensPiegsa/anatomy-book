The <span data-type="term">adrenal glands</span> are wedges of glandular
and neuroendocrine tissue adhering to the top of the kidneys by a
fibrous capsule ([\[link\]](#fig-ch18_06_01){: .autogenerated-content}).
The adrenal glands have a rich blood supply and experience one of the
highest rates of blood flow in the body. They are served by several
arteries branching off the aorta, including the suprarenal and renal
arteries. Blood flows to each adrenal gland at the adrenal cortex and
then drains into the adrenal medulla. Adrenal hormones are released into
the circulation via the left and right suprarenal veins.

</div>
The adrenal gland consists of an outer cortex of glandular tissue and an
inner medulla of nervous tissue. The cortex itself is divided into three
zones: the <span data-type="term">zona glomerulosa</span>, the <span
data-type="term">zona fasciculata</span>, and the <span
data-type="term">zona reticularis</span>. Each region secretes its own
set of hormones.
{: #fs-id1433491}

The <span data-type="term">adrenal cortex</span>, as a component of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, secretes steroid hormones
important for the regulation of the long-term stress response, blood
pressure and blood volume, nutrient uptake and storage, fluid and
electrolyte balance, and inflammation. The HPA axis involves the
stimulation of hormone release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
from the pituitary by the hypothalamus. ACTH then stimulates the adrenal
cortex to produce the hormone cortisol. This pathway will be discussed
in more detail below.
{: #fs-id1351232}

The <span data-type="term">adrenal medulla</span> is neuroendocrine
tissue composed of postganglionic sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
neurons. It is really an extension of the autonomic nervous system,
which regulates homeostasis in the body. The sympathomedullary (SAM)
pathway involves the stimulation of the medulla by impulses from the
hypothalamus via neurons from the thoracic spinal cord. The medulla is
stimulated to secrete the amine hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine.
{: #fs-id1391330}

One of the major functions of the adrenal gland is to respond to stress.
Stress can be either physical or psychological or both. Physical
stresses include exposing the body to injury, walking outside in cold
and wet conditions without a coat on, or malnutrition. Psychological
stresses include the perception of a physical threat, a fight with a
loved one, or just a bad day at school.
{: #fs-id1395108}

The body responds in different ways to short-term stress and long-term
stress following a pattern known as the <span data-type="term">general
adaptation syndrome (GAS)</span>. Stage one of GAS is called the <span
data-type="term">alarm reaction</span>. This is short-term stress, the
fight-or-flight response, mediated by the hormones epinephrine and
norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla via the SAM pathway. Their
function is to prepare the body for extreme physical exertion. Once this
stress is relieved, the body quickly returns to normal. The section on
the adrenal medulla covers this response in more detail.
{: #fs-id1475689}

If the stress is not soon relieved, the body adapts to the stress in the
second stage called the <span data-type="term">stage of
resistance</span>. If a person is starving for example, the body may
send signals to the gastrointestinal tract to maximize the absorption of
nutrients from food.
{: #fs-id810203}

If the stress continues for a longer term however, the body responds
with symptoms quite different than the fight-or-flight response. During
the <span data-type="term">stage of exhaustion</span>, individuals may
begin to suffer depression, the suppression of their immune response,
severe fatigue, or even a fatal heart attack. These symptoms are
mediated by the hormones of the adrenal cortex, especially cortisol,
released as a result of signals from the HPA axis.
{: #fs-id1233913}

Adrenal hormones also have several non–stress-related functions,
including the increase of blood sodium and glucose levels, which will be
described in detail below.
{: #fs-id1357668}

# Adrenal Cortex
{: data-type="title"}

The adrenal cortex consists of multiple layers of lipid-storing cells
that occur in three structurally distinct regions. Each of these regions
produces different hormones.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1421740" markdown="1">
## Hormones of the Zona Glomerulosa
{: data-type="title"}

The most superficial region of the adrenal cortex is the zona
glomerulosa, which produces a group of hormones collectively referred to
as <span data-type="term">mineralocorticoids</span> because of their
effect on body minerals, especially sodium and potassium. These hormones
are essential for fluid and electrolyte balance.
{: #fs-id1414548}

<span data-type="term">Aldosterone</span> is the major
mineralocorticoid. It is important in the regulation of the
concentration of sodium and potassium ions in urine, sweat, and saliva.
For example, it is released in response to elevated blood K<sup>+</sup>,
low blood Na<sup>+</sup>, low blood pressure, or low blood volume. In
response, aldosterone increases the excretion of K<sup>+</sup> and the
retention of Na<sup>+</sup>, which in turn increases blood volume and
blood pressure. Its secretion is prompted when CRH from the hypothalamus
triggers ACTH release from the anterior pituitary.
{: #fs-id1416120}

Aldosterone is also a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system (RAAS) in which specialized cells of the kidneys secrete the
enzyme renin in response to low blood volume or low blood pressure.
Renin then catalyzes the conversion of the blood protein
angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, to the hormone angiotensin I.
Angiotensin I is converted in the lungs to angiotensin II by <span
data-type="term">angiotensin-converting enzyme</span> (ACE). Angiotensin
II has three major functions:
{: #fs-id1383725}

1.  Initiating vasoconstriction of the arterioles, decreasing blood flow
2.  Stimulating kidney tubules to reabsorb NaCl and water, increasing
    blood volume
3.  Signaling the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone, the effects of
    which further contribute to fluid retention, restoring blood
    pressure and blood volume
{: #fs-id1350273}

For individuals with hypertension, or high blood pressure, drugs are
available that block the production of angiotensin II. These drugs,
known as ACE inhibitors, block the ACE enzyme from converting
angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thus mitigating the latter’s ability to
increase blood pressure.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1481100" markdown="1">
## Hormones of the Zona Fasciculata
{: data-type="title"}

The intermediate region of the adrenal cortex is the zona fasciculata,
named as such because the cells form small fascicles (bundles) separated
by tiny blood vessels. The cells of the zona fasciculata produce
hormones called <span data-type="term">glucocorticoids</span> because of
their role in glucose metabolism. The most important of these is <span
data-type="term">cortisol</span>, some of which the liver converts to
cortisone. A glucocorticoid produced in much smaller amounts is
corticosterone. In response to long-term stressors, the hypothalamus
secretes CRH, which in turn triggers the release of ACTH by the anterior
pituitary. ACTH triggers the release of the glucocorticoids. Their
overall effect is to inhibit tissue building while stimulating the
breakdown of stored nutrients to maintain adequate fuel supplies. In
conditions of long-term stress, for example, cortisol promotes the
catabolism of glycogen to glucose, the catabolism of stored
triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol, and the catabolism of
muscle proteins into amino acids. These raw materials can then be used
to synthesize additional glucose and ketones for use as body fuels. The
hippocampus, which is part of the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortices
and important in memory formation, is highly sensitive to stress levels
because of its many glucocorticoid receptors.
{: #fs-id1474330}

You are probably familiar with prescription and over-the-counter
medications containing glucocorticoids, such as cortisone injections
into inflamed joints, prednisone tablets and steroid-based inhalers used
to manage severe asthma, and hydrocortisone creams applied to relieve
itchy skin rashes. These drugs reflect another role of cortisol—the
downregulation of the immune system, which inhibits the inflammatory
response.

## Hormones of the Zona Reticularis
{: data-type="title"}

The deepest region of the adrenal cortex is the zona reticularis, which
produces small amounts of a class of steroid sex hormones called
androgens. During puberty and most of adulthood, androgens are produced
in the gonads. The androgens produced in the zona reticularis supplement
the gonadal androgens. They are produced in response to ACTH from the
anterior pituitary and are converted in the tissues to testosterone or
estrogens. In adult women, they may contribute to the sex drive, but
their function in adult men is not well understood. In post-menopausal
women, as the functions of the ovaries decline, the main source of
estrogens becomes the androgens produced by the zona reticularis.

# Adrenal Medulla
{: data-type="title"}

As noted earlier, the adrenal cortex releases glucocorticoids in
response to long-term stress such as severe illness. In contrast, the
adrenal medulla releases its hormones in response to acute, short-term
stress mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).
{: #fs-id796824}

The medullary tissue is composed of unique postganglionic SNS neurons
called <span data-type="term">chromaffin</span> cells, which are large
and irregularly shaped, and produce the neurotransmitters <span
data-type="term">epinephrine</span> (also called adrenaline) and <span
data-type="term">norepinephrine</span> (or noradrenaline). Epinephrine
is produced in greater quantities—approximately a 4 to 1 ratio with
norepinephrine—and is the more powerful hormone. Because the chromaffin
cells release epinephrine and norepinephrine into the systemic
circulation, where they travel widely and exert effects on distant
cells, they are considered hormones. Derived from the amino acid
tyrosine, they are chemically classified as catecholamines.
{: #fs-id1375277}

The secretion of medullary epinephrine and norepinephrine is controlled
by a neural pathway that originates from the hypothalamus in response to
danger or stress (the SAM pathway). Both epinephrine and norepinephrine
signal the liver and skeletal muscle cells to convert glycogen into
glucose, resulting in increased blood glucose levels. These hormones
increase the heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure to prepare the body
to fight the perceived threat or flee from it. In addition, the pathway
dilates the airways, raising blood oxygen levels. It also prompts
vasodilation, further increasing the oxygenation of important organs
such as the lungs, brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. At the same time,
it triggers vasoconstriction to blood vessels serving less essential
organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skin, and
downregulates some components of the immune system. Other effects
include a dry mouth, loss of appetite, pupil dilation, and a loss of
peripheral vision. The major hormones of the adrenal glands are
summarized in [\[link\]](#tbl-ch18_05){: .autogenerated-content}.

# Disorders Involving the Adrenal Glands
{: data-type="title"}

Several disorders are caused by the dysregulation of the hormones
produced by the adrenal glands. For example, Cushing’s disease is a
disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels and the accumulation
of lipid deposits on the face and neck. It is caused by hypersecretion
of cortisol. The most common source of Cushing’s disease is a pituitary
tumor that secretes cortisol or ACTH in abnormally high amounts. Other
common signs of Cushing’s disease include the development of a
moon-shaped face, a buffalo hump on the back of the neck, rapid weight
gain, and hair loss. Chronically elevated glucose levels are also
associated with an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In
addition to hyperglycemia, chronically elevated glucocorticoids
compromise immunity, resistance to infection, and memory, and can result
in rapid weight gain and hair loss.
{: #fs-id1475149}

In contrast, the hyposecretion of corticosteroids can result in
Addison’s disease, a rare disorder that causes low blood glucose levels
and low blood sodium levels. The signs and symptoms of Addison’s disease
are vague and are typical of other disorders as well, making diagnosis
difficult. They may include general weakness, abdominal pain, weight
loss, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and cravings for salty food.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The adrenal glands, located superior to each kidney, consist of two
regions: the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortex—the
outer layer of the gland—produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids,
and androgens. The adrenal medulla at the core of the gland produces
epinephrine and norepinephrine.
{: #fs-id1204821}

The adrenal glands mediate a short-term stress response and a long-term
stress response. A perceived threat results in the secretion of
epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, which mediate
the fight-or-flight response. The long-term stress response is mediated
by the secretion of CRH from the hypothalamus, which triggers ACTH,
which in turn stimulates the secretion of corticosteroids from the
adrenal cortex. The mineralocorticoids, chiefly aldosterone, cause
sodium and fluid retention, which increases blood volume and blood
pressure.
