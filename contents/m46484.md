title: Axial Muscles of the Head, Neck, and Back
layout: page

<div data-type="abstract" markdown="1">
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Identify the axial muscles of the face, head, and neck
* Identify the movement and function of the face, head, and neck muscles

</div>
The skeletal muscles are divided into <span
data-type="term">axial</span> (muscles of the trunk and head) and <span
data-type="term">appendicular</span> (muscles of the arms and legs)
categories. This system reflects the bones of the skeleton system, which
are also arranged in this manner. The axial muscles are grouped based on
location, function, or both. Some of the axial muscles may seem to blur
the boundaries because they cross over to the appendicular skeleton. The
first grouping of the axial muscles you will review includes the muscles
of the head and neck, then you will review the muscles of the vertebral
column, and finally you will review the oblique and rectus muscles.

# Muscles That Create Facial Expression
{: data-type="title"}

The origins of the muscles of facial expression are on the surface of
the skull (remember, the origin of a muscle does not move). The
insertions of these muscles have fibers intertwined with connective
tissue and the dermis of the skin. Because the muscles insert in the
skin rather than on bone, when they contract, the skin moves to create
facial expression ([\[link\]](#fig-ch11_03_01){:
.autogenerated-content}).

Many of the muscles of facial expression insert into the skin
surrounding the eyelids, nose and mouth, producing facial expressions by
moving the skin rather than bones.

The <span data-type="term">orbicularis oris</span> is a circular muscle
that moves the lips, and the <span data-type="term">orbicularis
oculi</span> is a circular muscle that closes the eye. The <span
data-type="term">occipitofrontalis</span> muscle moves up the scalp and
eyebrows. The muscle has a frontal belly and an occipital (near the
occipital bone on the posterior part of the skull) belly. In other
words, there is a muscle on the forehead (<span
data-type="term">frontalis</span>) and one on the back of the head
(<span data-type="term">occipitalis</span>), but there is no muscle
across the top of the head. Instead, the two bellies are connected by a
broad tendon called the <span data-type="term">epicranial
aponeurosis</span>, or galea aponeurosis (galea = “apple”). The
physicians originally studying human anatomy thought the skull looked
like an apple.
{: #fs-id2361275}

The majority of the face is composed of the <span
data-type="term">buccinator</span> muscle, which compresses the cheek.
This muscle allows you to whistle, blow, and suck; and it contributes to
the action of chewing. There are several small facial muscles, one of
which is the <span data-type="term">corrugator supercilii</span>, which
is the prime mover of the eyebrows. Place your finger on your eyebrows
at the point of the bridge of the nose. Raise your eyebrows as if you
were surprised and lower your eyebrows as if you were frowning. With
these movements, you can feel the action of the corrugator supercilli.

the tongue in a loop or flattening it).

<span data-type="title">Anesthesia and the Tongue Muscles</span> Before
surgery, a patient must be made ready for general anesthesia. The normal
homeostatic controls of the body are put “on hold” so that the patient
can be prepped for surgery. Control of respiration must be switched from
the patient’s homeostatic control to the control of the
anesthesiologist. The drugs used for anesthesia relax a majority of the
body’s muscles.
{: #fs-id2488758}

Among the muscles affected during general anesthesia are those that are
necessary for breathing and moving the tongue. Under anesthesia, the
tongue can relax and partially or fully block the airway, and the
muscles of respiration may not move the diaphragm or chest wall. To
avoid possible complications, the safest procedure to use on a patient
is called endotracheal intubation. Placing a tube into the trachea
allows the doctors to maintain a patient’s (open) airway to the lungs
and seal the airway off from the oropharynx. Post-surgery, the
anesthesiologist gradually changes the mixture of the gases that keep
the patient unconscious, and when the muscles of respiration begin to
function, the tube is removed. It still takes about 30 minutes for a
patient to wake up, and for breathing muscles to regain control of
respiration. After surgery, most people have a sore or scratchy throat
for a few days.

# Muscles of the Posterior Neck and the Back
{: data-type="title"}

The posterior muscles of the neck are primarily concerned with head
movements, like extension. The back muscles stabilize and move the
vertebral column, and are grouped according to the lengths and direction
of the fascicles.
{: #fs-id1848914}

The <span data-type="term">splenius</span> muscles originate at the
midline and run laterally and superiorly to their insertions. From the
sides and the back of the neck, the <span data-type="term">splenius
capitis</span> inserts onto the head region, and the <span
data-type="term">splenius cervicis</span> extends onto the cervical
region. These muscles can extend the head, laterally flex it, and rotate
it ([\[link\]](#fig-ch11_03_08){: .autogenerated-content}).

The <span data-type="term">erector spinae group</span> forms the
majority of the muscle mass of the back and it is the primary extensor
of the vertebral column. It controls flexion, lateral flexion, and
rotation of the vertebral column, and maintains the lumbar curve. The
erector spinae comprises the iliocostalis (laterally placed) group, the
longissimus (intermediately placed) group, and the spinalis (medially
placed) group.
{: #fs-id2586421}

The <span data-type="term">iliocostalis group</span> includes the <span
data-type="term">iliocostalis cervicis</span>, associated with the
cervical region; the <span data-type="term">iliocostalis
thoracis</span>, associated with the thoracic region; and the <span
data-type="term">iliocostalis lumborum</span>, associated with the
lumbar region. The three muscles of the <span
data-type="term">longissimus group</span> are the <span
data-type="term">longissimus capitis</span>, associated with the head
region; the <span data-type="term">longissimus cervicis</span>,
associated with the cervical region; and the <span
data-type="term">longissimus thoracis</span>, associated with the
thoracic region. The third group, the <span data-type="term">spinalis
group</span>, comprises the <span data-type="term">spinalis
capitis</span> (head region), the <span data-type="term">spinalis
cervicis</span> (cervical region), and the <span
data-type="term">spinalis thoracis</span> (thoracic region).
{: #fs-id2419122}

The <span data-type="term">transversospinales</span> muscles run from
the transverse processes to the spinous processes of the vertebrae.
Similar to the erector spinae muscles, the semispinalis muscles in this
group are named for the areas of the body with which they are
associated. The semispinalis muscles include the <span
data-type="term">semispinalis capitis</span>, the <span
data-type="term">semispinalis cervicis</span>, and the <span
data-type="term">semispinalis thoracis</span>. The <span
data-type="term">multifidus</span> muscle of the lumbar region helps
extend and laterally flex the vertebral column.
{: #fs-id2808964}

Important in the stabilization of the vertebral column is the <span
data-type="term">segmental muscle group</span>, which includes the
interspinales and intertransversarii muscles. These muscles bring
together the spinous and transverse processes of each consecutive
vertebra. Finally, the <span data-type="term">scalene muscles</span>
work together to flex, laterally flex, and rotate the head. They also
contribute to deep inhalation. The scalene muscles include the <span
data-type="term">anterior scalene</span> muscle (anterior to the middle
scalene), the <span data-type="term">middle scalene</span> muscle (the
longest, intermediate between the anterior and posterior scalenes), and
the <span data-type="term">posterior scalene</span> muscle (the
smallest, posterior to the middle scalene).

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Muscles are either axial muscles or appendicular. The axial muscles are
grouped based on location, function, or both. Some axial muscles cross
over to the appendicular skeleton. The muscles of the head and neck are
all axial. The muscles in the face create facial expression by inserting
into the skin rather than onto bone. Muscles that move the eyeballs are
extrinsic, meaning they originate outside of the eye and insert onto it.
Tongue muscles are both extrinsic and intrinsic. The genioglossus
depresses the tongue and moves it anteriorly; the styloglossus lifts the
tongue and retracts it; the palatoglossus elevates the back of the
tongue; and the hyoglossus depresses and flattens it. The muscles of the
anterior neck facilitate swallowing and speech, stabilize the hyoid bone
and position the larynx. The muscles of the neck stabilize and move the
head. The sternocleidomastoid divides the neck into anterior and
posterior triangles.
{: #fs-id2253683}

The muscles of the back and neck that move the vertebral column are
complex, overlapping, and can be divided into five groups. The splenius
group includes the splenius capitis and the splenius cervicis. The
erector spinae has three subgroups. The iliocostalis group includes the
iliocostalis cervicis, the iliocostalis thoracis, and the iliocostalis
lumborum. The longissimus group includes the longissimus capitis, the
longissimus cervicis, and the longissimus thoracis. The spinalis group
includes the spinalis capitis, the spinalis cervicis, and the spinalis
thoracis. The transversospinales include the semispinalis capitis,
semispinalis cervicis, semispinalis thoracis, multifidus, and rotatores.
The segmental muscles include the interspinales and intertransversarii.
Finally, the scalenes include the anterior scalene, middle scalene, and
posterior scalene.
