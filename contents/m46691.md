<div data-type="abstract" markdown="1">
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Trace the generation of the formed elements of blood from bone marrow
  stem cells
* Discuss the role of hemopoietic growth factors in promoting the
  production of the formed elements

</div>
The lifespan of the formed elements is very brief. Although one type of
leukocyte called memory cells can survive for years, most erythrocytes,
leukocytes, and platelets normally live only a few hours to a few weeks.
Thus, the body must form new blood cells and platelets quickly and
continuously. When you donate a unit of blood during a blood drive
(approximately 475 mL, or about 1 pint), your body typically replaces
the donated plasma within 24 hours, but it takes about 4 to 6 weeks to
replace the blood cells. This restricts the frequency with which donors
can contribute their blood. The process by which this replacement occurs
is called <span data-type="term">hemopoiesis</span>, or hematopoiesis
(from the Greek root haima- = “blood”; -poiesis = “production”).

# Sites of Hemopoiesis
{: data-type="title"}

Prior to birth, hemopoiesis occurs in a number of tissues, beginning
with the yolk sac of the developing embryo, and continuing in the fetal
liver, spleen, lymphatic tissue, and eventually the red bone marrow.
Following birth, most hemopoiesis occurs in the red marrow, a connective
tissue within the spaces of spongy (cancellous) bone tissue. In
children, hemopoiesis can occur in the medullary cavity of long bones;
in adults, the process is largely restricted to the cranial and pelvic
bones, the vertebrae, the sternum, and the proximal epiphyses of the
femur and humerus.
{: #fs-id2473411}

Throughout adulthood, the liver and spleen maintain their ability to
generate the formed elements. This process is referred to as
extramedullary hemopoiesis (meaning hemopoiesis outside the medullary
cavity of adult bones). When a disease such as bone cancer destroys the
bone marrow, causing hemopoiesis to fail, extramedullary hemopoiesis may
be initiated.

# Differentiation of Formed Elements from Stem Cells
{: data-type="title"}

All formed elements arise from stem cells of the red bone marrow. Recall
that stem cells undergo mitosis plus cytokinesis (cellular division) to
give rise to new daughter cells: One of these remains a stem cell and
the other differentiates into one of any number of diverse cell types.
Stem cells may be viewed as occupying a hierarchal system, with some
loss of the ability to diversify at each step. The <span
data-type="term">totipotent stem cell</span> is the zygote, or
fertilized egg. The totipotent (toti- = “all”) stem cell gives rise to
all cells of the human body. The next level is the <span
data-type="term">pluripotent stem cell</span>, which gives rise to
multiple types of cells of the body and some of the supporting fetal
membranes. Beneath this level, the mesenchymal cell is a stem cell that
develops only into types of connective tissue, including fibrous
connective tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood, but not epithelium,
muscle, and nervous tissue. One step lower on the hierarchy of stem
cells is the <span data-type="term">hemopoietic stem cell</span>, or
<span data-type="term">hemocytoblast</span>. All of the formed elements
of blood originate from this specific type of cell.
{: #fs-id1514207}

Hemopoiesis begins when the hemopoietic stem cell is exposed to
appropriate chemical stimuli collectively called <span
data-type="term">hemopoietic growth factors</span>, which prompt it to
divide and differentiate. One daughter cell remains a hemopoietic stem
cell, allowing hemopoiesis to continue. The other daughter cell becomes
either of two types of more specialized stem cells
([\[link\]](#fig-ch19_02_01){: .autogenerated-content}):
{: #fs-id1424251}

* <span data-type="term">Lymphoid stem cells</span> give rise to a class
  of leukocytes known as lymphocytes, which include the various T cells,
  B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, all of which function in
  immunity. However, hemopoiesis of lymphocytes progresses somewhat
  differently from the process for the other formed elements. In brief,
  lymphoid stem cells quickly migrate from the bone marrow to lymphatic
  tissues, including the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, where their
  production and differentiation continues. B cells are so named since
  they mature in the bone marrow, while T cells mature in the thymus.
* <span data-type="term">Myeloid stem cells</span> give rise to all the
  other formed elements, including the erythrocytes; megakaryocytes that
  produce platelets; and a myeloblast lineage that gives rise to
  monocytes and three forms of granular leukocytes: neutrophils,
  eosinophils, and basophils.

Lymphoid and myeloid stem cells do not immediately divide and
differentiate into mature formed elements. As you can see in
[\[link\]](#fig-ch19_02_01){: .autogenerated-content}, there are several
intermediate stages of precursor cells (literally, forerunner cells),
many of which can be recognized by their names, which have the suffix
-blast. For instance, megakaryoblasts are the precursors of
megakaryocytes, and proerythroblasts become reticulocytes, which eject
their nucleus and most other organelles before maturing into
erythrocytes.

# Hemopoietic Growth Factors
{: data-type="title"}

Development from stem cells to precursor cells to mature cells is again
initiated by hemopoietic growth factors. These include the following:
{: #fs-id2979580}

* <span data-type="term">Erythropoietin (EPO)</span> is a glycoprotein
  hormone secreted by the interstitial fibroblast cells of the kidneys
  in response to low oxygen levels. It prompts the production of
  erythrocytes. Some athletes use synthetic EPO as a
  performance-enhancing drug (called blood doping) to increase RBC
  counts and subsequently increase oxygen delivery to tissues throughout
  the body. EPO is a banned substance in most organized sports, but it
  is also used medically in the treatment of certain anemia,
  specifically those triggered by certain types of cancer, and other
  disorders in which increased erythrocyte counts and oxygen levels are
  desirable.
* <span data-type="term">Thrombopoietin</span>, another glycoprotein
  hormone, is produced by the liver and kidneys. It triggers the
  development of megakaryocytes into platelets.
* <span data-type="term">Cytokines</span> are glycoproteins secreted by
  a wide variety of cells, including red bone marrow, leukocytes,
  macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. They act locally as
  autocrine or paracrine factors, stimulating the proliferation of
  progenitor cells and helping to stimulate both nonspecific and
  specific resistance to disease. There are two major subtypes of
  cytokines known as colony-stimulating factors and interleukins.
  * <span data-type="term">Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs)</span> are
    glycoproteins that act locally, as autocrine or paracrine factors.
    Some trigger the differentiation of myeloblasts into granular
    leukocytes, namely, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. These
    are referred to as granulocyte CSFs. A different CSF induces the
    production of monocytes, called monocyte CSFs. Both granulocytes and
    monocytes are stimulated by GM-CSF; granulocytes, monocytes,
    platelets, and erythrocytes are stimulated by multi-CSF. Synthetic
    forms of these hormones are often administered to patients with
    various forms of cancer who are receiving chemotherapy to revive
    their WBC counts.
  * <span data-type="term">Interleukins</span> are another class of
    cytokine signaling molecules important in hemopoiesis. They were
    initially thought to be secreted uniquely by leukocytes and to
    communicate only with other leukocytes, and were named accordingly,
    but are now known to be produced by a variety of cells including
    bone marrow and endothelium. Researchers now suspect that
    interleukins may play other roles in body functioning, including
    differentiation and maturation of cells, producing immunity and
    inflammation. To date, more than a dozen interleukins have been
    identified, with others likely to follow. They are generally
    numbered IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, etc.

Everyday Connection
</div>
<span data-type="title">Blood Doping</span> In its original intent, the
term blood doping was used to describe the practice of injecting by
transfusion supplemental RBCs into an individual, typically to enhance
performance in a sport. Additional RBCs would deliver more oxygen to the
tissues, providing extra aerobic capacity, clinically referred to as
VO<sub>2</sub> max. The source of the cells was either from the
recipient (autologous) or from a donor with compatible blood
(homologous). This practice was aided by the well-developed techniques
of harvesting, concentrating, and freezing of the RBCs that could be
later thawed and injected, yet still retain their functionality. These
practices are considered illegal in virtually all sports and run the
risk of infection, significantly increasing the viscosity of the blood
and the potential for transmission of blood-borne pathogens if the blood
was collected from another individual.
{: #fs-id2584331}

With the development of synthetic EPO in the 1980s, it became possible
to provide additional RBCs by artificially stimulating RBC production in
the bone marrow. Originally developed to treat patients suffering from
anemia, renal failure, or cancer treatment, large quantities of EPO can
be generated by recombinant DNA technology. Synthetic EPO is injected
under the skin and can increase hematocrit for many weeks. It may also
induce polycythemia and raise hematocrit to 70 or greater. This
increased viscosity raises the resistance of the blood and forces the
heart to pump more powerfully; in extreme cases, it has resulted in
death. Other drugs such as cobalt II chloride have been shown to
increase natural EPO gene expression. Blood doping has become
problematic in many sports, especially cycling. Lance Armstrong, winner
of seven Tour de France and many other cycling titles, was stripped of
his victories and admitted to blood doping in 2013.

# Bone Marrow Sampling and Transplants
{: data-type="title"}

Sometimes, a healthcare provider will order a <span
data-type="term">bone marrow biopsy</span>, a diagnostic test of a
sample of red bone marrow, or a <span data-type="term">bone marrow
transplant</span>, a treatment in which a donor’s healthy bone
marrow—and its stem cells—replaces the faulty bone marrow of a patient.
These tests and procedures are often used to assist in the diagnosis and
treatment of various severe forms of anemia, such as thalassemia major
and sickle cell anemia, as well as some types of cancer, specifically
leukemia.
{: #fs-id2110925}

In the past, when a bone marrow sample or transplant was necessary, the
procedure would have required inserting a large-bore needle into the
region near the iliac crest of the pelvic bones (os coxae). This
location was preferred, since its location close to the body surface
makes it more accessible, and it is relatively isolated from most vital
organs. Unfortunately, the procedure is quite painful.
{: #fs-id2753010}

Now, direct sampling of bone marrow can often be avoided. In many cases,
stem cells can be isolated in just a few hours from a sample of a
patient’s blood. The isolated stem cells are then grown in culture using
the appropriate hemopoietic growth factors, and analyzed or sometimes
frozen for later use.
{: #fs-id2593696}

For an individual requiring a transplant, a matching donor is essential
to prevent the immune system from destroying the donor cells—a
phenomenon known as tissue rejection. To treat patients with bone marrow
transplants, it is first necessary to destroy the patient’s own diseased
marrow through radiation and/or chemotherapy. Donor bone marrow stem
cells are then intravenously infused. From the bloodstream, they
establish themselves in the recipient’s bone marrow.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Through the process of hemopoiesis, the formed elements of blood are
continually produced, replacing the relatively short-lived erythrocytes,
leukocytes, and platelets. Hemopoiesis begins in the red bone marrow,
with hemopoietic stem cells that differentiate into myeloid and lymphoid
lineages. Myeloid stem cells give rise to most of the formed elements.
Lymphoid stem cells give rise only to the various lymphocytes designated
as B and T cells, and NK cells. Hemopoietic growth factors, including
erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, colony-stimulating factors, and
interleukins, promote the proliferation and differentiation of formed
elements.
