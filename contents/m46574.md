The defining characteristic of the somatic nervous system is that it
controls skeletal muscles. Somatic senses inform the nervous system
about the external environment, but the response to that is through
voluntary muscle movement. The term “voluntary” suggests that there is a
conscious decision to make a movement. However, some aspects of the
somatic system use voluntary muscles without conscious control. One
example is the ability of our breathing to switch to unconscious control
while we are focused on another task. However, the muscles that are
responsible for the basic process of breathing are also utilized for
speech, which is entirely voluntary.

# Cortical Responses
{: data-type="title"}

Let’s start with sensory stimuli that have been registered through
receptor cells and the information relayed to the CNS along ascending
pathways. In the cerebral cortex, the initial processing of sensory
perception progresses to associative processing and then integration in
multimodal areas of cortex. These levels of processing can lead to the
incorporation of sensory perceptions into memory, but more importantly,
they lead to a response. The completion of cortical processing through
the primary, associative, and integrative sensory areas initiates a
similar progression of motor processing, usually in different cortical
areas.
{: #fs-id2137057}

Whereas the sensory cortical areas are located in the occipital,
temporal, and parietal lobes, motor functions are largely controlled by
the frontal lobe. The most anterior regions of the frontal lobe—the
prefrontal areas—are important for <span data-type="term">executive
functions</span>, which are those cognitive functions that lead to
goal-directed behaviors. These higher cognitive processes include <span
data-type="term">working memory</span>, which has been called a “mental
scratch pad,” that can help organize and represent information that is
not in the immediate environment. The prefrontal lobe is responsible for
aspects of attention, such as inhibiting distracting thoughts and
actions so that a person can focus on a goal and direct behavior toward
achieving that goal.
{: #fs-id2441635}

The functions of the prefrontal cortex are integral to the personality
of an individual, because it is largely responsible for what a person
intends to do and how they accomplish those plans. A famous case of
damage to the prefrontal cortex is that of Phineas Gage, dating back to
1848. He was a railroad worker who had a metal spike impale his
prefrontal cortex ([\[link\]](#fig-ch14_03_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). He survived the accident, but according to
second-hand accounts, his personality changed drastically. Friends
described him as no longer acting like himself. Whereas he was a
hardworking, amiable man before the accident, he turned into an
irritable, temperamental, and lazy man after the accident. Many of the
accounts of his change may have been inflated in the retelling, and some
behavior was likely attributable to alcohol used as a pain medication.
However, the accounts suggest that some aspects of his personality did
change. Also, there is new evidence that though his life changed
dramatically, he was able to become a functioning stagecoach driver,
suggesting that the brain has the ability to recover even from major
trauma such as this.

## Secondary Motor Cortices
{: data-type="title"}

In generating motor responses, the executive functions of the prefrontal
cortex will need to initiate actual movements. One way to define the
prefrontal area is any region of the frontal lobe that does not elicit
movement when electrically stimulated. These are primarily in the
anterior part of the frontal lobe. The regions of the frontal lobe that
remain are the regions of the cortex that produce movement. The
prefrontal areas project into the secondary motor cortices, which
include the <span data-type="term">premotor cortex</span> and the <span
data-type="term">supplemental motor area</span>.
{: #fs-id2696671}

Two important regions that assist in planning and coordinating movements
are located adjacent to the primary motor cortex. The premotor cortex is
more lateral, whereas the supplemental motor area is more medial and
superior. The premotor area aids in controlling movements of the core
muscles to maintain posture during movement, whereas the supplemental
motor area is hypothesized to be responsible for planning and
coordinating movement. The supplemental motor area also manages
sequential movements that are based on prior experience (that is,
learned movements). Neurons in these areas are most active leading up to
the initiation of movement. For example, these areas might prepare the
body for the movements necessary to drive a car in anticipation of a
traffic light changing.
{: #fs-id2625110}

Adjacent to these two regions are two specialized motor planning
centers. The <span data-type="term">frontal eye fields</span> are
responsible for moving the eyes in response to visual stimuli. There are
direct connections between the frontal eye fields and the superior
colliculus. Also, anterior to the premotor cortex and primary motor
cortex is <span data-type="term">Broca’s area</span>. This area is
responsible for controlling movements of the structures of speech
production. The area is named after a French surgeon and anatomist who
studied patients who could not produce speech. They did not have
impairments to understanding speech, only to producing speech sounds,
suggesting a damaged or underdeveloped Broca’s area.

## Primary Motor Cortex
{: data-type="title"}

The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the
frontal lobe. A neurosurgeon, Walter Penfield, described much of the
basic understanding of the primary motor cortex by electrically
stimulating the surface of the cerebrum. Penfield would probe the
surface of the cortex while the patient was only under local anesthesia
so that he could observe responses to the stimulation. This led to the
belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated muscle movement. We
now know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas
that aid in planning movement, and its principle output stimulates
spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction.
{: #fs-id1435300}

The primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary
somatosensory cortex, in that it has a topographical map of the body,
creating a motor homunculus (see [\[link\]](/m46557#fig-ch14_02_05){:
.autogenerated-content}). The neurons responsible for musculature in the
feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with
the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest of the longitudinal
fissure. The hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus. Also,
the relative space allotted for the different regions is exaggerated in
muscles that have greater enervation. The greatest amount of cortical
space is given to muscles that perform fine, agile movements, such as
the muscles of the fingers and the lower face. The “power muscles” that
perform coarser movements, such as the buttock and back muscles, occupy
much less space on the motor cortex.

# Descending Pathways
{: data-type="title"}

The motor output from the cortex descends into the brain stem and to the
spinal cord to control the musculature through motor neurons. Neurons
located in the primary motor cortex, named <span data-type="term">Betz
cells</span>, are large cortical neurons that synapse with lower motor
neurons in the spinal cord or the brain stem. The two descending
pathways travelled by the axons of Betz cells are the <span
data-type="term">corticospinal tract</span> and the <span
data-type="term">corticobulbar tract</span>. Both tracts are named for
their origin in the cortex and their targets—either the spinal cord or
the brain stem (the term “bulbar” refers to the brain stem as the bulb,
or enlargement, at the top of the spinal cord).
{: #fs-id2458260}

These two descending pathways are responsible for the conscious or
voluntary movements of skeletal muscles. Any motor command from the
primary motor cortex is sent down the axons of the Betz cells to
activate upper motor neurons in either the cranial motor nuclei or in
the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The axons of the corticobulbar
tract are ipsilateral, meaning they project from the cortex to the motor
nucleus on the same side of the nervous system. Conversely, the axons of
the corticospinal tract are largely contralateral, meaning that they
cross the midline of the brain stem or spinal cord and synapse on the
opposite side of the body. Therefore, the right motor cortex of the
cerebrum controls muscles on the left side of the body, and vice versa.
{: #fs-id1383807}

The corticospinal tract descends from the cortex through the deep white
matter of the cerebrum. It then passes between the caudate nucleus and
putamen of the basal nuclei as a bundle called the <span
data-type="term">internal capsule</span>. The tract then passes through
the midbrain as the <span data-type="term">cerebral peduncles</span>,
after which it burrows through the pons. Upon entering the medulla, the
tracts make up the large white matter tract referred to as the <span
data-type="term">pyramids</span> ([\[link\]](#fig-ch14_03_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). The defining landmark of the medullary-spinal
border is the <span data-type="term">pyramidal decussation</span>, which
is where most of the fibers in the corticospinal tract cross over to the
opposite side of the brain. At this point, the tract separates into two
parts, which have control over different domains of the musculature.
{: #fs-id1723870}

<figure id="fig-ch14_03_02">
<div data-type="title">
Corticospinal Tract
</div>
<figcaption>
The major descending tract that controls skeletal muscle movements is
the corticospinal tract. It is composed of two neurons, the upper motor
neuron and the lower motor neuron. The upper motor neuron has its cell
body in the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe and synapses on the
lower motor neuron, which is in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and
projects to the skeletal muscle in the periphery.

## Appendicular Control
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">lateral corticospinal tract</span> is
composed of the fibers that cross the midline at the pyramidal
decussation (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch14_03_02){: .autogenerated-content}).
The axons cross over from the anterior position of the pyramids in the
medulla to the lateral column of the spinal cord. These axons are
responsible for controlling appendicular muscles.
{: #fs-id2071044}

This influence over the appendicular muscles means that the lateral
corticospinal tract is responsible for moving the muscles of the arms
and legs. The ventral horn in both the lower cervical spinal cord and
the lumbar spinal cord both have wider ventral horns, representing the
greater number of muscles controlled by these motor neurons. The <span
data-type="term">cervical enlargement</span> is particularly large
because there is greater control over the fine musculature of the upper
limbs, particularly of the fingers. The <span data-type="term">lumbar
enlargement</span> is not as significant in appearance because there is
less fine motor control of the lower limbs.
{: #fs-id2256441}

</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2574409" markdown="1">
## Axial Control
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">anterior corticospinal tract</span> is
responsible for controlling the muscles of the body trunk (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch14_03_02){: .autogenerated-content}). These axons do
not decussate in the medulla. Instead, they remain in an anterior
position as they descend the brain stem and enter the spinal cord. These
axons then travel to the spinal cord level at which they synapse with a
lower motor neuron. Upon reaching the appropriate level, the axons
decussate, entering the ventral horn on the opposite side of the spinal
cord from which they entered. In the ventral horn, these axons synapse
with their corresponding lower motor neurons. The lower motor neurons
are located in the medial regions of the ventral horn, because they
control the axial muscles of the trunk.
{: #fs-id2765700}

Because movements of the body trunk involve both sides of the body, the
anterior corticospinal tract is not entirely contralateral. Some
collateral branches of the tract will project into the ipsilateral
ventral horn to control synergistic muscles on that side of the body, or
to inhibit antagonistic muscles through interneurons within the ventral
horn. Through the influence of both sides of the body, the anterior
corticospinal tract can coordinate postural muscles in broad movements
of the body. These coordinating axons in the anterior corticospinal
tract are often considered bilateral, as they are both ipsilateral and
contralateral.

# Extrapyramidal Controls
{: data-type="title"}

Other descending connections between the brain and the spinal cord are
called the <span data-type="term">extrapyramidal system</span>. The name
comes from the fact that this system is outside the corticospinal
pathway, which includes the pyramids in the medulla. A few pathways
originating from the brain stem contribute to this system.
{: #fs-id2684714}

The <span data-type="term">tectospinal tract</span> projects from the
midbrain to the spinal cord and is important for postural movements that
are driven by the superior colliculus. The name of the tract comes from
an alternate name for the superior colliculus, which is the tectum. The
<span data-type="term">reticulospinal tract</span> connects the
reticular system, a diffuse region of gray matter in the brain stem,
with the spinal cord. This tract influences trunk and proximal limb
muscles related to posture and locomotion. The reticulospinal tract also
contributes to muscle tone and influences autonomic functions. The <span
data-type="term">vestibulospinal tract</span> connects the brain stem
nuclei of the vestibular system with the spinal cord. This allows
posture, movement, and balance to be modulated on the basis of
equilibrium information provided by the vestibular system.
{: #fs-id2144788}

The pathways of the extrapyramidal system are influenced by subcortical
structures. For example, connections between the secondary motor
cortices and the extrapyramidal system modulate spine and cranium
movements. The basal nuclei, which are important for regulating movement
initiated by the CNS, influence the extrapyramidal system as well as its
thalamic feedback to the motor cortex.
{: #fs-id1909106}

The conscious movement of our muscles is more complicated than simply
sending a single command from the precentral gyrus down to the proper
motor neurons. During the movement of any body part, our muscles relay
information back to the brain, and the brain is constantly sending
“revised” instructions back to the muscles. The cerebellum is important
in contributing to the motor system because it compares cerebral motor
commands with proprioceptive feedback. The corticospinal fibers that
project to the ventral horn of the spinal cord have branches that also
synapse in the pons, which project to the cerebellum. Also, the
proprioceptive sensations of the dorsal column system have a collateral
projection to the medulla that projects to the cerebellum. These two
streams of information are compared in the cerebellar cortex. Conflicts
between the motor commands sent by the cerebrum and body position
information provided by the proprioceptors cause the cerebellum to
stimulate the <span data-type="term">red nucleus</span> of the midbrain.
The red nucleus then sends corrective commands to the spinal cord along
the <span data-type="term">rubrospinal tract</span>. The name of this
tract comes from the word for red that is seen in the English word
“ruby.”
{: #fs-id1543169}

A good example of how the cerebellum corrects cerebral motor commands
can be illustrated by walking in water. An original motor command from
the cerebrum to walk will result in a highly coordinated set of learned
movements. However, in water, the body cannot actually perform a typical
walking movement as instructed. The cerebellum can alter the motor
command, stimulating the leg muscles to take larger steps to overcome
the water resistance. The cerebellum can make the necessary changes
through the rubrospinal tract. Modulating the basic command to walk also
relies on spinal reflexes, but the cerebellum is responsible for
calculating the appropriate response. When the cerebellum does not work
properly, coordination and balance are severely affected. The most
dramatic example of this is during the overconsumption of alcohol.
Alcohol inhibits the ability of the cerebellum to interpret
proprioceptive feedback, making it more difficult to coordinate body
movements, such as walking a straight line, or guide the movement of the
hand to touch the tip of the nose.

# Ventral Horn Output
{: data-type="title"}

The somatic nervous system provides output strictly to skeletal muscles.
The lower motor neurons, which are responsible for the contraction of
these muscles, are found in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These
large, multipolar neurons have a corona of dendrites surrounding the
cell body and an axon that extends out of the ventral horn. This axon
travels through the ventral nerve root to join the emerging spinal
nerve. The axon is relatively long because it needs to reach muscles in
the periphery of the body. The diameters of cell bodies may be on the
order of hundreds of micrometers to support the long axon; some axons
are a meter in length, such as the lumbar motor neurons that innervate
muscles in the first digits of the feet.
{: #fs-id2627639}

The axons will also branch to innervate multiple muscle fibers.
Together, the motor neuron and all the muscle fibers that it controls
make up a motor unit. Motor units vary in size. Some may contain up to
1000 muscle fibers, such as in the quadriceps, or they may only have 10
fibers, such as in an extraocular muscle. The number of muscle fibers
that are part of a motor unit corresponds to the precision of control of
that muscle. Also, muscles that have finer motor control have more motor
units connecting to them, and this requires a larger topographical field
in the primary motor cortex.
{: #fs-id2763982}

Motor neuron axons connect to muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction.
This is a specialized synaptic structure at which multiple axon
terminals synapse with the muscle fiber sarcolemma. The synaptic end
bulbs of the motor neurons secrete acetylcholine, which binds to
receptors on the sarcolemma. The binding of acetylcholine opens
ligand-gated ion channels, increasing the movement of cations across the
sarcolemma. This depolarizes the sarcolemma, initiating muscle
contraction. Whereas other synapses result in graded potentials that
must reach a threshold in the postsynaptic target, activity at the
neuromuscular junction reliably leads to muscle fiber contraction with
every nerve impulse received from a motor neuron. However, the strength
of contraction and the number of fibers that contract can be affected by
the frequency of the motor neuron impulses.

# Reflexes
{: data-type="title"}

This chapter began by introducing reflexes as an example of the basic
elements of the somatic nervous system. Simple somatic reflexes do not
include the higher centers discussed for conscious or voluntary aspects
of movement. Reflexes can be spinal or cranial, depending on the nerves
and central components that are involved. The example described at the
beginning of the chapter involved heat and pain sensations from a hot
stove causing withdrawal of the arm through a connection in the spinal
cord that leads to contraction of the biceps brachii. The description of
this withdrawal reflex was simplified, for the sake of the introduction,
to emphasize the parts of the somatic nervous system. But to consider
reflexes fully, more attention needs to be given to this example.
{: #fs-id1953146}

As you withdraw your hand from the stove, you do not want to slow that
reflex down. As the biceps brachii contracts, the antagonistic triceps
brachii needs to relax. Because the neuromuscular junction is strictly
excitatory, the biceps will contract when the motor nerve is active.
Skeletal muscles do not actively relax. Instead the motor neuron needs
to “quiet down,” or be inhibited. In the hot-stove withdrawal reflex,
this occurs through an interneuron in the spinal cord. The interneuron’s
cell body is located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The
interneuron receives a synapse from the axon of the sensory neuron that
detects that the hand is being burned. In response to this stimulation
from the sensory neuron, the interneuron then inhibits the motor neuron
that controls the triceps brachii. This is done by releasing a
neurotransmitter or other signal that hyperpolarizes the motor neuron
connected to the triceps brachii, making it less likely to initiate an
action potential. With this motor neuron being inhibited, the triceps
brachii relaxes. Without the antagonistic contraction, withdrawal from
the hot stove is faster and keeps further tissue damage from occurring.
{: #fs-id2133457}

Another example of a withdrawal reflex occurs when you step on a painful
stimulus, like a tack or a sharp rock. The nociceptors that are
activated by the painful stimulus activate the motor neurons responsible
for contraction of the tibialis anterior muscle. This causes
dorsiflexion of the foot. An inhibitory interneuron, activated by a
collateral branch of the nociceptor fiber, will inhibit the motor
neurons of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to cancel plantar
flexion. An important difference in this reflex is that plantar flexion
is most likely in progress as the foot is pressing down onto the tack.
Contraction of the tibialis anterior is not the most important aspect of
the reflex, as continuation of plantar flexion will result in further
damage from stepping onto the tack.
{: #fs-id2349137}

Another type of reflex is a <span data-type="term">stretch
reflex</span>. In this reflex, when a skeletal muscle is stretched, a
muscle spindle receptor is activated. The axon from this receptor
structure will cause direct contraction of the muscle. A collateral of
the muscle spindle fiber will also inhibit the motor neuron of the
antagonist muscles. The reflex helps to maintain muscles at a constant
length. A common example of this reflex is the knee jerk that is
elicited by a rubber hammer struck against the patellar ligament in a
physical exam.
{: #fs-id2093774}

A specialized reflex to protect the surface of the eye is the <span
data-type="term">corneal reflex</span>, or the eye blink reflex. When
the cornea is stimulated by a tactile stimulus, or even by bright light
in a related reflex, blinking is initiated. The sensory component
travels through the trigeminal nerve, which carries somatosensory
information from the face, or through the optic nerve, if the stimulus
is bright light. The motor response travels through the facial nerve and
innervates the orbicularis oculi on the same side. This reflex is
commonly tested during a physical exam using an air puff or a gentle
touch of a cotton-tipped applicator.

have a set of reflexes that are expected to have been crucial to
survival before the modern age. These reflexes disappear as the baby
grows, as some of them may be unnecessary as they age. The video
demonstrates a reflex called the Babinski reflex, in which the foot
flexes dorsally and the toes splay out when the sole of the foot is
lightly scratched. This is normal for newborns, but it is a sign of
reduced myelination of the spinal tract in adults. Why would this reflex
be a problem for an adult?

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The motor components of the somatic nervous system begin with the
frontal lobe of the brain, where the prefrontal cortex is responsible
for higher functions such as working memory. The integrative and
associate functions of the prefrontal lobe feed into the secondary motor
areas, which help plan movements. The premotor cortex and supplemental
motor area then feed into the primary motor cortex that initiates
movements. Large Betz cells project through the corticobulbar and
corticospinal tracts to synapse on lower motor neurons in the brain stem
and ventral horn of the spinal cord, respectively. These connections are
responsible for generating movements of skeletal muscles.
{: #fs-id2340954}

The extrapyramidal system includes projections from the brain stem and
higher centers that influence movement, mostly to maintain balance and
posture, as well as to maintain muscle tone. The superior colliculus and
red nucleus in the midbrain, the vestibular nuclei in the medulla, and
the reticular formation throughout the brain stem each have tracts
projecting to the spinal cord in this system. Descending input from the
secondary motor cortices, basal nuclei, and cerebellum connect to the
origins of these tracts in the brain stem.
{: #fs-id2533513}

All of these motor pathways project to the spinal cord to synapse with
motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These lower motor
neurons are the cells that connect to skeletal muscle and cause
contractions. These neurons project through the spinal nerves to connect
to the muscles at neuromuscular junctions. One motor neuron connects to
multiple muscle fibers within a target muscle. The number of fibers that
are innervated by a single motor neuron varies on the basis of the
precision necessary for that muscle and the amount of force necessary
for that motor unit. The quadriceps, for example, have many fibers
controlled by single motor neurons for powerful contractions that do not
need to be precise. The extraocular muscles have only a small number of
fibers controlled by each motor neuron because moving the eyes does not
require much force, but needs to be very precise.
{: #fs-id2417076}

Reflexes are the simplest circuits within the somatic nervous system. A
withdrawal reflex from a painful stimulus only requires the sensory
fiber that enters the spinal cord and the motor neuron that projects to
a muscle. Antagonist and postural muscles can be coordinated with the
withdrawal, making the connections more complex. The simple, single
neuronal connection is the basis of somatic reflexes. The corneal reflex
is contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle to blink the eyelid when
something touches the surface of the eye. Stretch reflexes maintain a
constant length of muscles by causing a contraction of a muscle to
compensate for a stretch that can be sensed by a specialized receptor
called a muscle spindle.

Watch this [video][1] to learn more about the descending motor pathway
for the somatic nervous system. The autonomic connections are mentioned,
which are covered in another chapter. From this brief video, only some
of the descending motor pathway of the somatic nervous system is
described. Which division of the pathway is described and which division
is left out?

Visit this [site][2] to read about an elderly woman who starts to lose
the ability to control fine movements, such as speech and the movement
of limbs. Many of the usual causes were ruled out. It was not a stroke,
Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, or thyroid dysfunction. The next most
obvious cause was medication, so her pharmacist had to be consulted. The
side effect of a drug meant to help her sleep had resulted in changes in
motor control. What regions of the nervous system are likely to be the
focus of haloperidol side effects?

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id2260596" data-label="" markdown="1">
The movement disorders were similar to those seen in movement disorders
of the extrapyramidal system, which would mean the basal nuclei are the
most likely source of haloperidol side effects. In fact, haloperidol
affects dopamine activity, which is a prominent part of the chemistry of
the basal nuclei.

Watch this [video][4] to learn more about newborn reflexes. Newborns
have a set of reflexes that are expected to have been crucial to
survival before the modern age. These reflexes disappear as the baby
grows, as some of them may be unnecessary as they age. The video
demonstrates a reflex called the Babinski reflex, in which the foot
flexes dorsally and the toes splay out when the sole of the foot is
lightly scratched. This is normal for newborns, but it is a sign of
reduced myelination of the spinal tract in adults. Why would this reflex
be a problem for an adult?

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id2197560" data-label="" markdown="1">
While walking, the sole of the foot may be scraped or scratched by many
things. If the foot still reacted as in the Babinski reflex, an adult
might lose their balance while walking.

The prefrontal lobotomy is a drastic—and largely
out-of-practice—procedure used to disconnect that portion of the
cerebral cortex from the rest of the frontal lobe and the diencephalon
as a psychiatric therapy. Why would this have been thought necessary for
someone with a potentially uncontrollable behavior?

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id2110324" data-label="" markdown="1">
The prefrontal cortex is involved in decision-making functions that lead
to motor responses through connections to the more posterior motor
regions. These early aspects of behavior are often associated with a
person’s personality, so disrupting those connections will lead to
severe changes in behavior.

Though reflexes are simple circuits within the nervous system, they are
representative of the more involved circuits of the somatic nervous
system and can be used to quickly assess the state of neurological
function for a person.
