Chemical digestion in the small intestine relies on the activities of
three accessory digestive organs: the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder
([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_06_01){: .autogenerated-content}). The digestive
role of the liver is to produce bile and export it to the duodenum. The
gallbladder primarily stores, concentrates, and releases bile. The
pancreas produces pancreatic juice, which contains digestive enzymes and
bicarbonate ions, and delivers it to the duodenum.

![This diagram shows the accessory organs of the digestive system. The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and their major parts are shown.](../resources/2422_Accessory_Organs.jpg "The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are considered accessory digestive organs, but their roles in the digestive system are vital."){: #fig-ch24_06_01 data-media-type="image/jpg" data-title="Accessory Organs "}

# The Liver

The <span data-type="term">liver</span> is the largest gland in the
body, weighing about three pounds in an adult. It is also one of the
most important organs. In addition to being an accessory digestive
organ, it plays a number of roles in metabolism and regulation. The
liver lies inferior to the diaphragm in the right upper quadrant of the
abdominal cavity and receives protection from the surrounding ribs.

The liver is divided into two primary lobes: a large right lobe and a
much smaller left lobe. In the right lobe, some anatomists also identify
an inferior quadrate lobe and a posterior caudate lobe, which are
defined by internal features. The liver is connected to the abdominal
wall and diaphragm by five peritoneal folds referred to as ligaments.
These are the falciform ligament, the coronary ligament, two lateral
ligaments, and the ligamentum teres hepatis. The falciform ligament and
ligamentum teres hepatis are actually remnants of the umbilical vein,
and separate the right and left lobes anteriorly. The lesser omentum
tethers the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach.

The <span data-type="term">porta hepatis</span> (“gate to the liver”) is
where the <span data-type="term">hepatic artery</span> and <span
data-type="term">hepatic portal vein</span> enter the liver. These two
vessels, along with the common hepatic duct, run behind the lateral
border of the lesser omentum on the way to their destinations. As shown
in [\[link\]](#fig-ch24_06_02){: .autogenerated-content}, the hepatic
artery delivers oxygenated blood from the heart to the liver. The
hepatic portal vein delivers partially deoxygenated blood containing
nutrients absorbed from the small intestine and actually supplies more
oxygen to the liver than do the much smaller hepatic arteries. In
addition to nutrients, drugs and toxins are also absorbed. After
processing the bloodborne nutrients and toxins, the liver releases
nutrients needed by other cells back into the blood, which drains into
the central vein and then through the hepatic vein to the inferior vena
cava. With this hepatic portal circulation, all blood from the
alimentary canal passes through the liver. This largely explains why the
liver is the most common site for the metastasis of cancers that
originate in the alimentary canal.

## Histology

The liver has three main components: hepatocytes, bile canaliculi, and
hepatic sinusoids. A <span data-type="term">hepatocyte</span> is the
liver’s main cell type, accounting for around 80 percent of the liver\'s
volume. These cells play a role in a wide variety of secretory,
metabolic, and endocrine functions. Plates of hepatocytes called hepatic
laminae radiate outward from the portal vein in each <span
data-type="term">hepatic lobule</span>.

Between adjacent hepatocytes, grooves in the cell membranes provide room
for each <span data-type="term">bile canaliculus</span> (plural =
canaliculi). These small ducts accumulate the bile produced by
hepatocytes. From here, bile flows first into bile ductules and then
into bile ducts. The bile ducts unite to form the larger right and left
hepatic ducts, which themselves merge and exit the liver as the <span
data-type="term">common hepatic duct</span>. This duct then joins with
the cystic duct from the gallbladder, forming the <span
data-type="term">common bile duct</span> through which bile flows into
the small intestine.

A <span data-type="term">hepatic sinusoid</span> is an open, porous
blood space formed by fenestrated capillaries from nutrient-rich hepatic
portal veins and oxygen-rich hepatic arteries. Hepatocytes are tightly
packed around the fenestrated endothelium of these spaces, giving them
easy access to the blood. From their central position, hepatocytes
process the nutrients, toxins, and waste materials carried by the blood.
Materials such as bilirubin are processed and excreted into the bile
canaliculi. Other materials including proteins, lipids, and
carbohydrates are processed and secreted into the sinusoids or just
stored in the cells until called upon. The hepatic sinusoids combine and
send blood to a <span data-type="term">central vein</span>. Blood then
flows through a <span data-type="term">hepatic vein</span> into the
inferior vena cava. This means that blood and bile flow in opposite
directions. The hepatic sinusoids also contain star-shaped <span
data-type="term">reticuloendothelial cells</span> (Kupffer cells),
phagocytes that remove dead red and white blood cells, bacteria, and
other foreign material that enter the sinusoids. The <span
data-type="term">portal triad</span> is a distinctive arrangement around
the perimeter of hepatic lobules, consisting of three basic structures:
a bile duct, a hepatic artery branch, and a hepatic portal vein branch.

## Bile

Recall that lipids are hydrophobic, that is, they do not dissolve in
water. Thus, before they can be digested in the watery environment of
the small intestine, large lipid globules must be broken down into
smaller lipid globules, a process called emulsification. <span
data-type="term">Bile</span> is a mixture secreted by the liver to
accomplish the emulsification of lipids in the small intestine.

Hepatocytes secrete about one liter of bile each day. A yellow-brown or
yellow-green alkaline solution (pH 7.6 to 8.6), bile is a mixture of
water, bile salts, bile pigments, phospholipids (such as lecithin),
electrolytes, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The components most
critical to emulsification are bile salts and phospholipids, which have
a nonpolar (hydrophobic) region as well as a polar (hydrophilic) region.
The hydrophobic region interacts with the large lipid molecules, whereas
the hydrophilic region interacts with the watery chyme in the intestine.
This results in the large lipid globules being pulled apart into many
tiny lipid fragments of about 1 *µ*m in diameter. This change
dramatically increases the surface area available for lipid-digesting
enzyme activity. This is the same way dish soap works on fats mixed with
water.

Bile salts act as emulsifying agents, so they are also important for the
absorption of digested lipids. While most constituents of bile are
eliminated in feces, bile salts are reclaimed by the <span
data-type="term">enterohepatic circulation</span>. Once bile salts reach
the ileum, they are absorbed and returned to the liver in the hepatic
portal blood. The hepatocytes then excrete the bile salts into newly
formed bile. Thus, this precious resource is recycled.

<span data-type="term">Bilirubin</span>, the main bile pigment, is a
waste product produced when the spleen removes old or damaged red blood
cells from the circulation. These breakdown products, including
proteins, iron, and toxic bilirubin, are transported to the liver via
the splenic vein of the hepatic portal system. In the liver, proteins
and iron are recycled, whereas bilirubin is excreted in the bile. It
accounts for the green color of bile. Bilirubin is eventually
transformed by intestinal bacteria into stercobilin, a brown pigment
that gives your stool its characteristic color! In some disease states,
bile does not enter the intestine, resulting in white (‘acholic’) stool
with a high fat content, since virtually no fats are broken down or
absorbed.

Hepatocytes work non-stop, but bile production increases when fatty
chyme enters the duodenum and stimulates the secretion of the gut
hormone secretin. Between meals, bile is produced but conserved. The
valve-like hepatopancreatic ampulla closes, allowing bile to divert to
the gallbladder, where it is concentrated and stored until the next
meal.

# The Pancreas

The soft, oblong, glandular <span data-type="term">pancreas</span> lies
transversely in the retroperitoneum behind the stomach. Its head is
nestled into the “c-shaped” curvature of the duodenum with the body
extending to the left about 15.2 cm (6 in) and ending as a tapering tail
in the hilum of the spleen. It is a curious mix of exocrine (secreting
digestive enzymes) and endocrine (releasing hormones into the blood)
functions ([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_06_03){: .autogenerated-content}).

![This figure shows the pancreas and its major parts. A magnified view of a small region of the pancreas shows the pancreatic islet cells, the acinar cells and the pancreatic duct.](../resources/2424_Exocrine_and_Endocrine_Pancreas.jpg "The pancreas has a head, a body, and a tail. It delivers pancreatic juice to the duodenum through the pancreatic duct."){: #fig-ch24_06_03 data-media-type="image/jpg" data-title="Exocrine and Endocrine Pancreas "}

The exocrine part of the pancreas arises as little grape-like cell
clusters, each called an <span data-type="term">acinus</span> (plural =
acini), located at the terminal ends of pancreatic ducts. These acinar
cells secrete enzyme-rich <span data-type="term">pancreatic juice</span>
into tiny merging ducts that form two dominant ducts. The larger duct
fuses with the common bile duct (carrying bile from the liver and
gallbladder) just before entering the duodenum via a common opening (the
hepatopancreatic ampulla). The smooth muscle sphincter of the
hepatopancreatic ampulla controls the release of pancreatic juice and
bile into the small intestine. The second and smaller pancreatic duct,
the <span data-type="term">accessory duct</span> (duct of Santorini),
runs from the pancreas directly into the duodenum, approximately 1 inch
above the hepatopancreatic ampulla. When present, it is a persistent
remnant of pancreatic development.

Scattered through the sea of exocrine acini are small islands of
endocrine cells, the islets of Langerhans. These vital cells produce the
hormones pancreatic polypeptide, insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin.

## Pancreatic Juice

The pancreas produces over a liter of pancreatic juice each day. Unlike
bile, it is clear and composed mostly of water along with some salts,
sodium bicarbonate, and several digestive enzymes. Sodium bicarbonate is
responsible for the slight alkalinity of pancreatic juice (pH 7.1 to
8.2), which serves to buffer the acidic gastric juice in chyme,
inactivate pepsin from the stomach, and create an optimal environment
for the activity of pH-sensitive digestive enzymes in the small
intestine. Pancreatic enzymes are active in the digestion of sugars,
proteins, and fats.

The pancreas produces protein-digesting enzymes in their inactive forms.
These enzymes are activated in the duodenum. If produced in an active
form, they would digest the pancreas (which is exactly what occurs in
the disease, pancreatitis). The intestinal brush border enzyme <span
data-type="term">enteropeptidase</span> stimulates the activation of
trypsin from trypsinogen of the pancreas, which in turn changes the
pancreatic enzymes procarboxypeptidase and chymotrypsinogen into their
active forms, carboxypeptidase and chymotrypsin.

The enzymes that digest starch (amylase), fat (lipase), and nucleic
acids (nuclease) are secreted in their active forms, since they do not
attack the pancreas as do the protein-digesting enzymes.

## Pancreatic Secretion

Regulation of pancreatic secretion is the job of hormones and the
parasympathetic nervous system. The entry of acidic chyme into the
duodenum stimulates the release of secretin, which in turn causes the
duct cells to release bicarbonate-rich pancreatic juice. The presence of
proteins and fats in the duodenum stimulates the secretion of CCK, which
then stimulates the acini to secrete enzyme-rich pancreatic juice and
enhances the activity of secretin. Parasympathetic regulation occurs
mainly during the cephalic and gastric phases of gastric secretion, when
vagal stimulation prompts the secretion of pancreatic juice.

Usually, the pancreas secretes just enough bicarbonate to counterbalance
the amount of HCl produced in the stomach. Hydrogen ions enter the blood
when bicarbonate is secreted by the pancreas. Thus, the acidic blood
draining from the pancreas neutralizes the alkaline blood draining from
the stomach, maintaining the pH of the venous blood that flows to the
liver.

# The Gallbladder

The <span data-type="term">gallbladder</span> is 8–10 cm (~3–4 in) long
and is nested in a shallow area on the posterior aspect of the right
lobe of the liver. This muscular sac stores, concentrates, and, when
stimulated, propels the bile into the duodenum via the common bile duct.
It is divided into three regions. The fundus is the widest portion and
tapers medially into the body, which in turn narrows to become the neck.
The neck angles slightly superiorly as it approaches the hepatic duct.
The cystic duct is 1–2 cm (less than 1 in) long and turns inferiorly as
it bridges the neck and hepatic duct.

The simple columnar epithelium of the gallbladder mucosa is organized in
rugae, similar to those of the stomach. There is no submucosa in the
gallbladder wall. The wall’s middle, muscular coat is made of smooth
muscle fibers. When these fibers contract, the gallbladder’s contents
are ejected through the <span data-type="term">cystic duct</span> and
into the bile duct ([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_06_04){:
.autogenerated-content}). Visceral peritoneum reflected from the liver
capsule holds the gallbladder against the liver and forms the outer coat
of the gallbladder. The gallbladder\'s mucosa absorbs water and ions
from bile, concentrating it by up to 10-fold.

![This figure shows the gallbladder and its major parts are labeled.](../resources/2425_Gallbladder.jpg "The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile, and releases it into the two-way cystic duct when it is needed by the small intestine."){: #fig-ch24_06_04 data-media-type="image/jpg" data-title="Gallbladder "}

# Chapter Review

Chemical digestion in the small intestine cannot occur without the help
of the liver and pancreas. The liver produces bile and delivers it to
the common hepatic duct. Bile contains bile salts and phospholipids,
which emulsify large lipid globules into tiny lipid droplets, a
necessary step in lipid digestion and absorption. The gallbladder stores
and concentrates bile, releasing it when it is needed by the small
intestine.

The pancreas produces the enzyme- and bicarbonate-rich pancreatic juice
and delivers it to the small intestine through ducts. Pancreatic juice
buffers the acidic gastric juice in chyme, inactivates pepsin from the
stomach, and enables the optimal functioning of digestive enzymes in the
small intestine.
