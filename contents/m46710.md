Recall that <span data-type="term">blood</span> is a connective tissue.
Like all connective tissues, it is made up of cellular elements and an
extracellular matrix. The cellular elements—referred to as the <span
data-type="term">formed elements</span>—include <span
data-type="term">red blood cells (RBCs)</span>, <span
data-type="term">white blood cells (WBCs)</span>, and cell fragments
called <span data-type="term">platelets</span>. The extracellular
matrix, called <span data-type="term">plasma</span>, makes blood unique
among connective tissues because it is fluid. This fluid, which is
mostly water, perpetually suspends the formed elements and enables them
to circulate throughout the body within the cardiovascular system.

# Functions of Blood
{: data-type="title"}

The primary function of blood is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to and
remove wastes from body cells, but that is only the beginning of the
story. The specific functions of blood also include defense,
distribution of heat, and maintenance of homeostasis.

## Transportation
{: data-type="title"}

Nutrients from the foods you eat are absorbed in the digestive tract.
Most of these travel in the bloodstream directly to the liver, where
they are processed and released back into the bloodstream for delivery
to body cells. Oxygen from the air you breathe diffuses into the blood,
which moves from the lungs to the heart, which then pumps it out to the
rest of the body. Moreover, endocrine glands scattered throughout the
body release their products, called hormones, into the bloodstream,
which carries them to distant target cells. Blood also picks up cellular
wastes and byproducts, and transports them to various organs for
removal. For instance, blood moves carbon dioxide to the lungs for
exhalation from the body, and various waste products are transported to
the kidneys and liver for excretion from the body in the form of urine
or bile.

## Defense
{: data-type="title"}

Many types of WBCs protect the body from external threats, such as
disease-causing bacteria that have entered the bloodstream in a wound.
Other WBCs seek out and destroy internal threats, such as cells with
mutated DNA that could multiply to become cancerous, or body cells
infected with viruses.
{: #fs-id2252310}

When damage to the vessels results in bleeding, blood platelets and
certain proteins dissolved in the plasma, the fluid portion of the
blood, interact to block the ruptured areas of the blood vessels
involved. This protects the body from further blood loss.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1261338" markdown="1">
## Maintenance of Homeostasis
{: data-type="title"}

Recall that body temperature is regulated via a classic
negative-feedback loop. If you were exercising on a warm day, your
rising core body temperature would trigger several homeostatic
mechanisms, including increased transport of blood from your core to
your body periphery, which is typically cooler. As blood passes through
the vessels of the skin, heat would be dissipated to the environment,
and the blood returning to your body core would be cooler. In contrast,
on a cold day, blood is diverted away from the skin to maintain a warmer
body core. In extreme cases, this may result in frostbite.
{: #fs-id2108450}

Blood also helps to maintain the chemical balance of the body. Proteins
and other compounds in blood act as buffers, which thereby help to
regulate the pH of body tissues. Blood also helps to regulate the water
content of body cells.

# Composition of Blood
{: data-type="title"}

You have probably had blood drawn from a superficial vein in your arm,
which was then sent to a lab for analysis. Some of the most common blood
tests—for instance, those measuring lipid or glucose levels in
plasma—determine which substances are present within blood and in what
quantities. Other blood tests check for the composition of the blood
itself, including the quantities and types of formed elements.
{: #fs-id2095884}

One such test, called a <span data-type="term">hematocrit</span>,
measures the percentage of RBCs, clinically known as erythrocytes, in a
blood sample. It is performed by spinning the blood sample in a
specialized centrifuge, a process that causes the heavier elements
suspended within the blood sample to separate from the lightweight,
liquid plasma ([\[link\]](#fig-ch19_01_01){: .autogenerated-content}).
Because the heaviest elements in blood are the erythrocytes, these
settle at the very bottom of the hematocrit tube. Located above the
erythrocytes is a pale, thin layer composed of the remaining formed
elements of blood. These are the WBCs, clinically known as leukocytes,
and the platelets, cell fragments also called thrombocytes. This layer
is referred to as the <span data-type="term">buffy coat</span> because
of its color; it normally constitutes less than 1 percent of a blood
sample. Above the buffy coat is the blood plasma, normally a pale,
straw-colored fluid, which constitutes the remainder of the sample.
{: #fs-id2365674}

The volume of erythrocytes after centrifugation is also commonly
referred to as <span data-type="term">packed cell volume (PCV)</span>.
In normal blood, about 45 percent of a sample is erythrocytes. The
hematocrit of any one sample can vary significantly, however, about
36–50 percent, according to gender and other factors. Normal hematocrit
values for females range from 37 to 47, with a mean value of 41; for
males, hematocrit ranges from 42 to 52, with a mean of 47. The
percentage of other formed elements, the WBCs and platelets, is
extremely small so it is not normally considered with the hematocrit. So
the mean plasma percentage is the percent of blood that is not
erythrocytes: for females, it is approximately 59 (or 100 minus 41), and
for males, it is approximately 53 (or 100 minus 47).

The cellular elements of blood include a vast number of erythrocytes and
comparatively fewer leukocytes and platelets. Plasma is the fluid in
which the formed elements are suspended. A sample of blood spun in a
centrifuge reveals that plasma is the lightest component. It floats at
the top of the tube separated from the heaviest elements, the
erythrocytes, by a buffy coat of leukocytes and platelets. Hematocrit is
the percentage of the total sample that is comprised of erythrocytes.
Depressed and elevated hematocrit levels are shown for comparison.

# Characteristics of Blood
{: data-type="title"}

When you think about blood, the first characteristic that probably comes
to mind is its color. Blood that has just taken up oxygen in the lungs
is bright red, and blood that has released oxygen in the tissues is a
more dusky red. This is because hemoglobin is a pigment that changes
color, depending upon the degree of oxygen saturation.
{: #fs-id1910265}

Blood is viscous and somewhat sticky to the touch. It has a viscosity
approximately five times greater than water. Viscosity is a measure of a
fluid’s thickness or resistance to flow, and is influenced by the
presence of the plasma proteins and formed elements within the blood.
The viscosity of blood has a dramatic impact on blood pressure and flow.
Consider the difference in flow between water and honey. The more
viscous honey would demonstrate a greater resistance to flow than the
less viscous water. The same principle applies to blood.
{: #fs-id2468492}

The normal temperature of blood is slightly higher than normal body
temperature—about 38 °C (or 100.4 °F), compared to 37 °C (or 98.6 °F)
for an internal body temperature reading, although daily variations of
0.5 °C are normal. Although the surface of blood vessels is relatively
smooth, as blood flows through them, it experiences some friction and
resistance, especially as vessels age and lose their elasticity, thereby
producing heat. This accounts for its slightly higher temperature.
{: #fs-id2271392}

The pH of blood averages about 7.4; however, it can range from 7.35 to
7.45 in a healthy person. Blood is therefore somewhat more basic
(alkaline) on a chemical scale than pure water, which has a pH of 7.0.
Blood contains numerous buffers that actually help to regulate pH.
{: #fs-id2355195}

Blood constitutes approximately 8 percent of adult body weight. Adult
males typically average about 5 to 6 liters of blood. Females average
4–5 liters.

# Blood Plasma
{: data-type="title"}

Like other fluids in the body, plasma is composed primarily of water: In
fact, it is about 92 percent water. Dissolved or suspended within this
water is a mixture of substances, most of which are proteins. There are
literally hundreds of substances dissolved or suspended in the plasma,
although many of them are found only in very small quantities.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id3236118" markdown="1">
## Plasma Proteins
{: data-type="title"}

About 7 percent of the volume of plasma—nearly all that is not water—is
made of proteins. These include several plasma proteins (proteins that
are unique to the plasma), plus a much smaller number of regulatory
proteins, including enzymes and some hormones. The major components of
plasma are summarized in [\[link\]](#fig-ch19_01_02){:
.autogenerated-content}.
{: #fs-id2713000}

The three major groups of plasma proteins are as follows:
{: #fs-id2290720}

* <span data-type="term">Albumin</span> is the most abundant of the
  plasma proteins. Manufactured by the liver, albumin molecules serve as
  binding proteins—transport vehicles for fatty acids and steroid
  hormones. Recall that lipids are hydrophobic; however, their binding
  to albumin enables their transport in the watery plasma. Albumin is
  also the most significant contributor to the osmotic pressure of
  blood; that is, its presence holds water inside the blood vessels and
  draws water from the tissues, across blood vessel walls, and into the
  bloodstream. This in turn helps to maintain both blood volume and
  blood pressure. Albumin normally accounts for approximately 54 percent
  of the total plasma protein content, in clinical levels of 3.5–5.0
  g/dL blood.
* The second most common plasma proteins are the <span
  data-type="term">globulins</span>. A heterogeneous group, there are
  three main subgroups known as alpha, beta, and gamma globulins. The
  alpha and beta globulins transport iron, lipids, and the fat-soluble
  vitamins A, D, E, and K to the cells; like albumin, they also
  contribute to osmotic pressure. The gamma globulins are proteins
  involved in immunity and are better known as an <span
  data-type="term">antibodies</span> or <span
  data-type="term">immunoglobulins</span>. Although other plasma
  proteins are produced by the liver, immunoglobulins are produced by
  specialized leukocytes known as plasma cells. (Seek additional content
  for more information about immunoglobulins.) Globulins make up
  approximately 38 percent of the total plasma protein volume, in
  clinical levels of 1.0–1.5 g/dL blood.
* The least abundant plasma protein is <span
  data-type="term">fibrinogen</span>. Like albumin and the alpha and
  beta globulins, fibrinogen is produced by the liver. It is essential
  for blood clotting, a process described later in this chapter.
  Fibrinogen accounts for about 7 percent of the total plasma protein
  volume, in clinical levels of 0.2–0.45 g/dL blood.

## Other Plasma Solutes
{: data-type="title"}

In addition to proteins, plasma contains a wide variety of other
substances. These include various electrolytes, such as sodium,
potassium, and calcium ions; dissolved gases, such as oxygen, carbon
dioxide, and nitrogen; various organic nutrients, such as vitamins,
lipids, glucose, and amino acids; and metabolic wastes. All of these
nonprotein solutes combined contribute approximately 1 percent to the
total volume of plasma.

<span data-type="title">Phlebotomy and Medical Lab Technology</span>
Phlebotomists are professionals trained to draw blood (phleb- = “a blood
vessel”; -tomy = “to cut”). When more than a few drops of blood are
required, phlebotomists perform a venipuncture, typically of a surface
vein in the arm. They perform a capillary stick on a finger, an earlobe,
or the heel of an infant when only a small quantity of blood is
required. An arterial stick is collected from an artery and used to
analyze blood gases. After collection, the blood may be analyzed by
medical laboratories or perhaps used for transfusions, donations, or
research. While many allied health professionals practice phlebotomy,
the American Society of Phlebotomy Technicians issues certificates to
individuals passing a national examination, and some large labs and
hospitals hire individuals expressively for their skill in phlebotomy.
{: #fs-id2979580}

Medical or clinical laboratories employ a variety of individuals in
technical positions:
{: #fs-id2650646}

* Medical technologists (MT), also known as clinical laboratory
  technologists (CLT), typically hold a bachelor’s degree and
  certification from an accredited training program. They perform a wide
  variety of tests on various body fluids, including blood. The
  information they provide is essential to the primary care providers in
  determining a diagnosis and in monitoring the course of a disease and
  response to treatment.
* Medical laboratory technicians (MLT) typically have an associate’s
  degree but may perform duties similar to those of an MT.
* Medical laboratory assistants (MLA) spend the majority of their time
  processing samples and carrying out routine assignments within the
  lab. Clinical training is required, but a degree may not be essential
  to obtaining a position.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Blood is a fluid connective tissue critical to the transportation of
nutrients, gases, and wastes throughout the body; to defend the body
against infection and other threats; and to the homeostatic regulation
of pH, temperature, and other internal conditions. Blood is composed of
formed elements—erythrocytes, leukocytes, and cell fragments called
platelets—and a fluid extracellular matrix called plasma. More than 90
percent of plasma is water. The remainder is mostly plasma
proteins—mainly albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen—and other dissolved
solutes such as glucose, lipids, electrolytes, and dissolved gases.
Because of the formed elements and the plasma proteins and other
solutes, blood is sticky and more viscous than water. It is also
slightly alkaline, and its temperature is slightly higher than normal
body temperature.
