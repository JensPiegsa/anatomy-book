# Digestive Processes
{: data-type="title"}

The processes of digestion include six activities: ingestion,
propulsion, mechanical or physical digestion, chemical digestion,
absorption, and defecation.
{: #fs-id1367786}

The first of these processes, <span data-type="term">ingestion</span>,
refers to the entry of food into the alimentary canal through the mouth.
There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes
that begin breaking down the carbohydrates in the food plus some lipid
digestion via lingual lipase. Chewing increases the surface area of the
food and allows an appropriately sized bolus to be produced.
{: #fs-id2142860}

Food leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel it
into the esophagus. This act of swallowing, the last voluntary act until
defecation, is an example of <span data-type="term">propulsion</span>,
which refers to the movement of food through the digestive tract. It
includes both the voluntary process of swallowing and the involuntary
process of peristalsis. <span data-type="term">Peristalsis</span>
consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation
of alimentary wall smooth muscles, which act to propel food along
([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_02_01){: .autogenerated-content}). These waves
also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so
powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if
you are standing on your head.

</figure>
Digestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes. <span
data-type="term">Mechanical digestion</span> is a purely physical
process that does not change the chemical nature of the food. Instead,
it makes the food smaller to increase both surface area and mobility. It
includes <span data-type="term">mastication</span>, or chewing, as well
as tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and mix food
with saliva. Although there may be a tendency to think that mechanical
digestion is limited to the first steps of the digestive process, it
occurs after the food leaves the mouth, as well. The mechanical churning
of food in the stomach serves to further break it apart and expose more
of its surface area to digestive juices, creating an acidic “soup”
called <span data-type="term">chyme</span>. <span
data-type="term">Segmentation</span>, which occurs mainly in the small
intestine, consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of the
muscularis layer of the alimentary canal. These contractions isolate
small sections of the intestine, moving their contents back and forth
while continuously subdividing, breaking up, and mixing the contents. By
moving food back and forth in the intestinal lumen, segmentation mixes
food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.
{: #fs-id1976578}

In <span data-type="term">chemical digestion</span>, starting in the
mouth, digestive secretions break down complex food molecules into their
chemical building blocks (for example, proteins into separate amino
acids). These secretions vary in composition, but typically contain
water, various enzymes, acids, and salts. The process is completed in
the small intestine.
{: #fs-id1640818}

Food that has been broken down is of no value to the body unless it
enters the bloodstream and its nutrients are put to work. This occurs
through the process of <span data-type="term">absorption</span>, which
takes place primarily within the small intestine. There, most nutrients
are absorbed from the lumen of the alimentary canal into the bloodstream
through the epithelial cells that make up the mucosa. Lipids are
absorbed into lacteals and are transported via the lymphatic vessels to
the bloodstream (the subclavian veins near the heart). The details of
these processes will be discussed later.
{: #fs-id2079518}

In <span data-type="term">defecation</span>, the final step in
digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body as feces.

<div data-type="title">
Aging and the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Digestive System: From Appetite Suppression to
Constipation</span> Age-related changes in the digestive system begin in
the mouth and can affect virtually every aspect of the digestive system.
Taste buds become less sensitive, so food isn’t as appetizing as it once
was. A slice of pizza is a challenge, not a treat, when you have lost
teeth, your gums are diseased, and your salivary glands aren’t producing
enough saliva. Swallowing can be difficult, and ingested food moves
slowly through the alimentary canal because of reduced strength and tone
of muscular tissue. Neurosensory feedback is also dampened, slowing the
transmission of messages that stimulate the release of enzymes and
hormones.
{: #fs-id1892333}

Pathologies that affect the digestive organs—such as hiatal hernia,
gastritis, and peptic ulcer disease—can occur at greater frequencies as
you age. Problems in the small intestine may include duodenal ulcers,
maldigestion, and malabsorption. Problems in the large intestine include
hemorrhoids, diverticular disease, and constipation. Conditions that
affect the function of accessory organs—and their abilities to deliver
pancreatic enzymes and bile to the small intestine—include jaundice,
acute pancreatitis, cirrhosis, and gallstones.
{: #fs-id1409614}

</div>
In some cases, a single organ is in charge of a digestive process. For
example, ingestion occurs only in the mouth and defecation only in the
anus. However, most digestive processes involve the interaction of
several organs and occur gradually as food moves through the alimentary
canal ([\[link\]](#fig-ch24_02_02){: .autogenerated-content}).

# Regulatory Mechanisms
{: data-type="title"}

Neural and endocrine regulatory mechanisms work to maintain the optimal
conditions in the lumen needed for digestion and absorption. These
regulatory mechanisms, which stimulate digestive activity through
mechanical and chemical activity, are controlled both extrinsically and
intrinsically.
{: #fs-id1748016}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1700679" markdown="1">
## Neural Controls
{: data-type="title"}

The walls of the alimentary canal contain a variety of sensors that help
regulate digestive functions. These include mechanoreceptors,
chemoreceptors, and osmoreceptors, which are capable of detecting
mechanical, chemical, and osmotic stimuli, respectively. For example,
these receptors can sense when the presence of food has caused the
stomach to expand, whether food particles have been sufficiently broken
down, how much liquid is present, and the type of nutrients in the food
(lipids, carbohydrates, and/or proteins). Stimulation of these receptors
provokes an appropriate reflex that furthers the process of digestion.
This may entail sending a message that activates the glands that secrete
digestive juices into the lumen, or it may mean the stimulation of
muscles within the alimentary canal, thereby activating peristalsis and
segmentation that move food along the intestinal tract.
{: #fs-id1748531}

The walls of the entire alimentary canal are embedded with nerve
plexuses that interact with the central nervous system and other nerve
plexuses—either within the same digestive organ or in different ones.
These interactions prompt several types of reflexes. Extrinsic nerve
plexuses orchestrate long reflexes, which involve the central and
autonomic nervous systems and work in response to stimuli from outside
the digestive system. Short reflexes, on the other hand, are
orchestrated by intrinsic nerve plexuses within the alimentary canal
wall. These two plexuses and their connections were introduced earlier
as the enteric nervous system. Short reflexes regulate activities in one
area of the digestive tract and may coordinate local peristaltic
movements and stimulate digestive secretions. For example, the sight,
smell, and taste of food initiate long reflexes that begin with a
sensory neuron delivering a signal to the medulla oblongata. The
response to the signal is to stimulate cells in the stomach to begin
secreting digestive juices in preparation for incoming food. In
contrast, food that distends the stomach initiates short reflexes that
cause cells in the stomach wall to increase their secretion of digestive
juices.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1224813" markdown="1">
## Hormonal Controls
{: data-type="title"}

A variety of hormones are involved in the digestive process. The main
digestive hormone of the stomach is gastrin, which is secreted in
response to the presence of food. Gastrin stimulates the secretion of
gastric acid by the parietal cells of the stomach mucosa. Other GI
hormones are produced and act upon the gut and its accessory organs.
Hormones produced by the duodenum include secretin, which stimulates a
watery secretion of bicarbonate by the pancreas; cholecystokinin (CCK),
which stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile from the
liver and release of bile from the gallbladder; and gastric inhibitory
peptide, which inhibits gastric secretion and slows gastric emptying and
motility. These GI hormones are secreted by specialized epithelial
cells, called endocrinocytes, located in the mucosal epithelium of the
stomach and small intestine. These hormones then enter the bloodstream,
through which they can reach their target organs.

The digestive system ingests and digests food, absorbs released
nutrients, and excretes food components that are indigestible. The six
activities involved in this process are ingestion, motility, mechanical
digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and defecation. These
processes are regulated by neural and hormonal mechanisms.
