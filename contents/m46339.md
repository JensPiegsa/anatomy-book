In approximately nine months, a single cell—a fertilized egg—develops
into a fully formed infant consisting of trillions of cells with myriad
specialized functions. The dramatic changes of fertilization, embryonic
development, and fetal development are followed by remarkable
adaptations of the newborn to life outside the womb. An offspring’s
normal development depends upon the appropriate synthesis of structural
and functional proteins. This, in turn, is governed by the genetic
material inherited from the parental egg and sperm, as well as
environmental factors.
