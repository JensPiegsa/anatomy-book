A <span data-type="term">fracture</span> is a broken bone. It will heal
whether or not a physician resets it in its anatomical position. If the
bone is not reset correctly, the healing process will keep the bone in
its deformed position.
{: #fs-id1859022}

When a broken bone is manipulated and set into its natural position
without surgery, the procedure is called a <span data-type="term">closed
reduction</span>. <span data-type="term">Open reduction</span> requires
surgery to expose the fracture and reset the bone. While some fractures
can be minor, others are quite severe and result in grave complications.
For example, a fractured diaphysis of the femur has the potential to
release fat globules into the bloodstream. These can become lodged in
the capillary beds of the lungs, leading to respiratory distress and if
not treated quickly, death.

# Types of Fractures
{: data-type="title"}

Fractures are classified by their complexity, location, and other
features ([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_05_01){: .autogenerated-content}).
[\[link\]](#tbl-ch06_04){: .autogenerated-content} outlines common types
of fractures. Some fractures may be described using more than one term
because it may have the features of more than one type (e.g., an open
transverse fracture).

illustration, each type of fracture is shown on the right femur from an
anterior view. In the closed fracture, the femur is broken in the middle
of the shaft with the upper and lower halves of the bone completely
separated. However, the two halves of the bones are still aligned in
that the broken edges are still facing each other. In an open fracture,
the femur is broken in the middle of the shaft with the upper and lower
halves of the bone completely separated. Unlike the closed fracture, in
the open fracture, the two bone halves are misaligned. The lower half is
turned laterally and it has protruded through the skin of the thigh. The
broken ends no longer line up with each other. In a transverse fracture,
the bone has a crack entirely through its width, however, the broken
ends are not separated. The crack is perpendicular to the long axis of
the bone. Arrows indicate that this is usually caused by compression of
the bone in a superior-inferior direction. A spiral fracture travels
diagonally through the diameter of the bone. In a comminuted fracture,
the bone has several connecting cracks at its middle. It is possible
that the bone could splinter into several small pieces at the site of
the comminuted fracture. In an impacted fracture, the crack zig zags
throughout the width of the bone like a lightning bolt. An arrow
indicates that these are usually caused by an impact that pushes the
femur up into the body. A greenstick fracture is a small crack that does
not extend through the entire width of the bone. The oblique fracture
shown here is travelling diagonally through the shaft of the femur at
about a thirty degree angle."> ![In this illustration, each type of

# Bone Repair
{: data-type="title"}

When a bone breaks, blood flows from any vessel torn by the fracture.
These vessels could be in the periosteum, osteons, and/or medullary
cavity. The blood begins to clot, and about six to eight hours after the
fracture, the clotting blood has formed a <span
data-type="term">fracture hematoma</span> ([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_05_02){:
.autogenerated-content}**a**{: data-effect="bold"}). The disruption of
blood flow to the bone results in the death of bone cells around the
fracture.

Stages in Fracture Repair

The healing of a bone fracture follows a series of progressive steps:
(a) A fracture hematoma forms. (b) Internal and external calli form. (c)
Cartilage of the calli is replaced by trabecular bone. (d) Remodeling

shows a left to right progression of bone repair. The break is shown in
the leftmost image, where the femur has an oblique, closed fracture in
the middle of its shaft. The next image magnifies the break, showing
that blood has filled the area between the broken bones. Blood has also
filled in around the lateral and medial sides of the break. The influx
of blood causes the broken area to swell, creating a hematoma. In the
next image, the hematoma has been replaced with an external callus
between the two broken ends. Within the internal callus, the blood
vessels have reconnected and some spongy bone has regenerated in the gap
between the two bone halves. In the next image, spongy bone has
completely regenerated, connecting the two broken ends, referred to as
the bony callus. The external callus still remains on the lateral and
medial sides of the break, as the compact bone has not yet regenerated.
In the final image, the compact bone has fully regenerated,
encapsulating the bony callus and completely reconnecting the two bone
halves. The bone has a slight bulge at the location of the healed
fracture, which is clearly shown in the final image, which shows a
zoomed out image of the completely healed femur."> ![This illustration

Within about 48 hours after the fracture, chondrocytes from the
endosteum have created an <span data-type="term">internal callus</span>
(plural = calli) by secreting a fibrocartilaginous matrix between the
two ends of the broken bone, while the periosteal chondrocytes and
osteoblasts create an <span data-type="term">external callus</span> of
hyaline cartilage and bone, respectively, around the outside of the
break ([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_05_02){: .autogenerated-content}**b**{:
data-effect="bold"}). This stabilizes the fracture.
{: #fs-id1738761}

Over the next several weeks, osteoclasts resorb the dead bone;
osteogenic cells become active, divide, and differentiate into
osteoblasts. The cartilage in the calli is replaced by trabecular bone
via endochondral ossification ([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_05_02){:
.autogenerated-content}**c**{: data-effect="bold"}).
{: #fs-id1804989}

Eventually, the internal and external calli unite, compact bone replaces
spongy bone at the outer margins of the fracture, and healing is
complete. A slight swelling may remain on the outer surface of the bone,
but quite often, that region undergoes remodeling
([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_05_02){: .autogenerated-content}**d**{:
data-effect="bold"}), and no external evidence of the fracture remains.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Fractured bones may be repaired by closed reduction or open reduction.
Fractures are classified by their complexity, location, and other
features. Common types of fractures are transverse, oblique, spiral,
comminuted, impacted, greenstick, open (or compound), and closed (or
simple). Healing of fractures begins with the formation of a hematoma,
followed by internal and external calli. Osteoclasts resorb dead bone,
while osteoblasts create new bone that replaces the cartilage in the
calli. The calli eventually unite, remodeling occurs, and healing is
complete.

In closed reduction, the broken ends of a fractured bone can be reset
without surgery. Open reduction requires surgery to return the broken
