The other major activity in the lungs is the process of respiration, the
process of gas exchange. The function of respiration is to provide
oxygen for use by body cells during cellular respiration and to
eliminate carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, from
the body. In order for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to
occur, both gases must be transported between the external and internal
respiration sites. Although carbon dioxide is more soluble than oxygen
in blood, both gases require a specialized transport system for the
majority of the gas molecules to be moved between the lungs and other
tissues.

# Oxygen Transport in the Blood
{: data-type="title"}

Even though oxygen is transported via the blood, you may recall that
oxygen is not very soluble in liquids. A small amount of oxygen does
dissolve in the blood and is transported in the bloodstream, but it is
only about 1.5% of the total amount. The majority of oxygen molecules
are carried from the lungs to the body’s tissues by a specialized
transport system, which relies on the erythrocyte—the red blood cell.
Erythrocytes contain a metalloprotein, hemoglobin, which serves to bind
oxygen molecules to the erythrocyte ([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_05_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). Heme is the portion of hemoglobin that
contains iron, and it is heme that binds oxygen. One erythrocyte
contains four iron ions, and because of this, each erythrocyte is
capable of carrying up to four molecules of oxygen. As oxygen diffuses
across the respiratory membrane from the alveolus to the capillary, it
also diffuses into the red blood cell and is bound by hemoglobin. The
following reversible chemical reaction describes the production of the
final product, <span data-type="term">oxyhemoglobin</span>
(Hb–O<sub>2</sub>), which is formed when oxygen binds to hemoglobin.
Oxyhemoglobin is a bright red-colored molecule that contributes to the
bright red color of oxygenated blood.

In this formula, Hb represents reduced hemoglobin, that is, hemoglobin
that does not have oxygen bound to it. There are multiple factors
involved in how readily heme binds to and dissociates from oxygen, which
will be discussed in the subsequent sections.

## Function of Hemoglobin
{: data-type="title"}

Hemoglobin is composed of subunits, a protein structure that is referred
to as a quaternary structure. Each of the four subunits that make up
hemoglobin is arranged in a ring-like fashion, with an iron atom
covalently bound to the heme in the center of each subunit. Binding of
the first oxygen molecule causes a conformational change in hemoglobin
that allows the second molecule of oxygen to bind more readily. As each
molecule of oxygen is bound, it further facilitates the binding of the
next molecule, until all four heme sites are occupied by oxygen. The
opposite occurs as well: After the first oxygen molecule dissociates and
is “dropped off” at the tissues, the next oxygen molecule dissociates
more readily. When all four heme sites are occupied, the hemoglobin is
said to be saturated. When one to three heme sites are occupied, the
hemoglobin is said to be partially saturated. Therefore, when
considering the blood as a whole, the percent of the available heme
units that are bound to oxygen at a given time is called hemoglobin
saturation. Hemoglobin saturation of 100 percent means that every heme
unit in all of the erythrocytes of the body is bound to oxygen. In a
healthy individual with normal hemoglobin levels, hemoglobin saturation
generally ranges from 95 percent to 99 percent.

## Oxygen Dissociation from Hemoglobin
{: data-type="title"}

Partial pressure is an important aspect of the binding of oxygen to and
disassociation from heme. An <span data-type="term">oxygen–hemoglobin
dissociation curve</span> is a graph that describes the relationship of
partial pressure to the binding of oxygen to heme and its subsequent
dissociation from heme ([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_05_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). Remember that gases travel from an area of
higher partial pressure to an area of lower partial pressure. In
addition, the affinity of an oxygen molecule for heme increases as more
oxygen molecules are bound. Therefore, in the oxygen–hemoglobin
saturation curve, as the partial pressure of oxygen increases, a
proportionately greater number of oxygen molecules are bound by heme.
Not surprisingly, the oxygen–hemoglobin saturation/dissociation curve
also shows that the lower the partial pressure of oxygen, the fewer
oxygen molecules are bound to heme. As a result, the partial pressure of
oxygen plays a major role in determining the degree of binding of oxygen
to heme at the site of the respiratory membrane, as well as the degree
of dissociation of oxygen from heme at the site of body tissues.

</figure>
The mechanisms behind the oxygen–hemoglobin saturation/dissociation
curve also serve as automatic control mechanisms that regulate how much
oxygen is delivered to different tissues throughout the body. This is
important because some tissues have a higher metabolic rate than others.
Highly active tissues, such as muscle, rapidly use oxygen to produce
ATP, lowering the partial pressure of oxygen in the tissue to about 20
mm Hg. The partial pressure of oxygen inside capillaries is about 100 mm
Hg, so the difference between the two becomes quite high, about 80 mm
Hg. As a result, a greater number of oxygen molecules dissociate from
hemoglobin and enter the tissues. The reverse is true of tissues, such
as adipose (body fat), which have lower metabolic rates. Because less
oxygen is used by these cells, the partial pressure of oxygen within
such tissues remains relatively high, resulting in fewer oxygen
molecules dissociating from hemoglobin and entering the tissue
interstitial fluid. Although venous blood is said to be deoxygenated,
some oxygen is still bound to hemoglobin in its red blood cells. This
provides an oxygen reserve that can be used when tissues suddenly demand
more oxygen.
{: #fs-id1545843}

Factors other than partial pressure also affect the oxygen–hemoglobin
saturation/dissociation curve. For example, a higher temperature
promotes hemoglobin and oxygen to dissociate faster, whereas a lower
temperature inhibits dissociation (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch23_05_02){:
.autogenerated-content}**, middle**{: data-effect="bold"}). However, the
human body tightly regulates temperature, so this factor may not affect
gas exchange throughout the body. The exception to this is in highly
active tissues, which may release a larger amount of energy than is
given off as heat. As a result, oxygen readily dissociates from
hemoglobin, which is a mechanism that helps to provide active tissues
with more oxygen.
{: #fs-id2493930}

Certain hormones, such as androgens, epinephrine, thyroid hormones, and
growth hormone, can affect the oxygen–hemoglobin
saturation/disassociation curve by stimulating the production of a
compound called 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) by erythrocytes. BPG is a
byproduct of glycolysis. Because erythrocytes do not contain
mitochondria, glycolysis is the sole method by which these cells produce
ATP. BPG promotes the disassociation of oxygen from hemoglobin.
Therefore, the greater the concentration of BPG, the more readily oxygen
dissociates from hemoglobin, despite its partial pressure.
{: #fs-id2754129}

The pH of the blood is another factor that influences the
oxygen–hemoglobin saturation/dissociation curve (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch23_05_02){: .autogenerated-content}). The <span
data-type="term">Bohr effect</span> is a phenomenon that arises from the
relationship between pH and oxygen’s affinity for hemoglobin: A lower,
more acidic pH promotes oxygen dissociation from hemoglobin. In
contrast, a higher, or more basic, pH inhibits oxygen dissociation from
hemoglobin. The greater the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood, the
more molecules that must be converted, which in turn generates hydrogen
ions and thus lowers blood pH. Furthermore, blood pH may become more
acidic when certain byproducts of cell metabolism, such as lactic acid,
carbonic acid, and carbon dioxide, are released into the bloodstream.

## Hemoglobin of the Fetus
{: data-type="title"}

The fetus has its own circulation with its own erythrocytes; however, it
is dependent on the mother for oxygen. Blood is supplied to the fetus by
way of the umbilical cord, which is connected to the placenta and
separated from maternal blood by the chorion. The mechanism of gas
exchange at the chorion is similar to gas exchange at the respiratory
membrane. However, the partial pressure of oxygen is lower in the
maternal blood in the placenta, at about 35 to 50 mm Hg, than it is in
maternal arterial blood. The difference in partial pressures between
maternal and fetal blood is not large, as the partial pressure of oxygen
in fetal blood at the placenta is about 20 mm Hg. Therefore, there is
not as much diffusion of oxygen into the fetal blood supply. The fetus’
hemoglobin overcomes this problem by having a greater affinity for
oxygen than maternal hemoglobin ([\[link\]](#fig-ch23_05_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). Both fetal and adult hemoglobin have four
subunits, but two of the subunits of fetal hemoglobin have a different
structure that causes fetal hemoglobin to have a greater affinity for
oxygen than does adult hemoglobin.

Although carbon dioxide is not considered to be highly soluble in blood,
a small fraction—about 7 to 10 percent—of the carbon dioxide that

dissolved carbon dioxide then travels in the bloodstream and when the
blood reaches the pulmonary capillaries, the dissolved carbon dioxide
diffuses across the respiratory membrane into the alveoli, where it is

Bicarbonate tends to build up in the erythrocytes, so that there is a
greater concentration of bicarbonate in the erythrocytes than in the
surrounding blood plasma. As a result, some of the bicarbonate will
leave the erythrocytes and move down its concentration gradient into the
plasma in exchange for chloride (Cl<sup>–</sup>) ions. This phenomenon
is referred to as the <span data-type="term">chloride shift</span> and
occurs because by exchanging one negative ion for another negative ion,
neither the electrical charge of the erythrocytes nor that of the blood
is altered.
{: #fs-id2560464}

At the pulmonary capillaries, the chemical reaction that produced
bicarbonate (shown above) is reversed, and carbon dioxide and water are
the products. Much of the bicarbonate in the plasma re-enters the
erythrocytes in exchange for chloride ions. Hydrogen ions and
bicarbonate ions join to form carbonic acid, which is converted into
carbon dioxide and water by carbonic anhydrase. Carbon dioxide diffuses
out of the erythrocytes and into the plasma, where it can further
diffuse across the respiratory membrane into the alveoli to be exhaled
during pulmonary ventilation.

Similar to the transport of oxygen by heme, the binding and dissociation
of carbon dioxide to and from hemoglobin is dependent on the partial
pressure of carbon dioxide. Because carbon dioxide is released from the
lungs, blood that leaves the lungs and reaches body tissues has a lower
partial pressure of carbon dioxide than is found in the tissues. As a
result, carbon dioxide leaves the tissues because of its higher partial
pressure, enters the blood, and then moves into red blood cells, binding
to hemoglobin. In contrast, in the pulmonary capillaries, the partial
pressure of carbon dioxide is high compared to within the alveoli. As a
result, carbon dioxide dissociates readily from hemoglobin and diffuses
across the respiratory membrane into the air.
{: #fs-id2350254}

In addition to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, the oxygen
saturation of hemoglobin and the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood
also influence the affinity of hemoglobin for carbon dioxide. The <span
data-type="term">Haldane effect</span> is a phenomenon that arises from
the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen and the affinity
of hemoglobin for carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin that is saturated with
oxygen does not readily bind carbon dioxide. However, when oxygen is not

readily binds to carbon dioxide.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Oxygen is primarily transported through the blood by erythrocytes. These
cells contain a metalloprotein called hemoglobin, which is composed of
four subunits with a ring-like structure. Each subunit contains one atom
of iron bound to a molecule of heme. Heme binds oxygen so that each
hemoglobin molecule can bind up to four oxygen molecules. When all of
the heme units in the blood are bound to oxygen, hemoglobin is
considered to be saturated. Hemoglobin is partially saturated when only
some heme units are bound to oxygen. An oxygen–hemoglobin
saturation/dissociation curve is a common way to depict the relationship
of how easily oxygen binds to or dissociates from hemoglobin as a
function of the partial pressure of oxygen. As the partial pressure of
oxygen increases, the more readily hemoglobin binds to oxygen. At the
same time, once one molecule of oxygen is bound by hemoglobin,
additional oxygen molecules more readily bind to hemoglobin. Other
factors such as temperature, pH, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide,
and the concentration of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate can enhance or inhibit
the binding of hemoglobin and oxygen as well. Fetal hemoglobin has a
different structure than adult hemoglobin, which results in fetal
hemoglobin having a greater affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin.
{: #fs-id2341449}

Carbon dioxide is transported in blood by three different mechanisms: as
dissolved carbon dioxide, as bicarbonate, or as carbaminohemoglobin. A
small portion of carbon dioxide remains. The largest amount of
transported carbon dioxide is as bicarbonate, formed in erythrocytes.
For this conversion, carbon dioxide is combined with water with the aid
of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. This combination forms carbonic
acid, which spontaneously dissociates into bicarbonate and hydrogen
ions. As bicarbonate builds up in erythrocytes, it is moved across the
membrane into the plasma in exchange for chloride ions by a mechanism
called the chloride shift. At the pulmonary capillaries, bicarbonate
re-enters erythrocytes in exchange for chloride ions, and the reaction
with carbonic anhydrase is reversed, recreating carbon dioxide and
water. Carbon dioxide then diffuses out of the erythrocyte and across
the respiratory membrane into the air. An intermediate amount of carbon
dioxide binds directly to hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin. The
partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen, as well as the oxygen
saturation of hemoglobin, influence how readily hemoglobin binds carbon
dioxide. The less saturated hemoglobin is and the lower the partial
pressure of oxygen in the blood is, the more readily hemoglobin binds to
carbon dioxide. This is an example of the Haldane effect.

When oxygen binds to the hemoglobin molecule, oxyhemoglobin is created,
which has a red color to it. Hemoglobin that is not bound to oxygen
tends to be more of a blue–purple color. Oxygenated blood traveling
through the systemic arteries has large amounts of oxyhemoglobin. As
blood passes through the tissues, much of the oxygen is released into
systemic capillaries. The deoxygenated blood returning through the
systemic veins, therefore, contains much smaller amounts of
oxyhemoglobin. The more oxyhemoglobin that is present in the blood, the
redder the fluid will be. As a result, oxygenated blood will be much
redder in color than deoxygenated blood.

Compare and contrast adult hemoglobin and fetal hemoglobin.

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id2203600" data-label="" markdown="1">
Both adult and fetal hemoglobin transport oxygen via iron molecules.
However, fetal hemoglobin has about a 20-fold greater affinity for
oxygen than does adult hemoglobin. This is due to a difference in
structure; fetal hemoglobin has two subunits that have a slightly
different structure than the subunits of adult hemoglobin.

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1574034" data-label="" markdown="1">
The relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen and the binding
of hemoglobin to oxygen is described by the oxygen–hemoglobin
saturation/dissociation curve. As the partial pressure of oxygen
increases, the number of oxygen molecules bound by hemoglobin increases,
thereby increasing the saturation of hemoglobin.

Describe three ways in which carbon dioxide can be transported.
{: #fs-id2762896}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id2567072" data-label="" markdown="1">
Carbon dioxide can be transported by three mechanisms: dissolved in
plasma, as bicarbonate, or as carbaminohemoglobin. Dissolved in plasma,
carbon dioxide molecules simply diffuse into the blood from the tissues.
Bicarbonate is created by a chemical reaction that occurs mostly in
erythrocytes, joining carbon dioxide and water by carbonic anhydrase,
producing carbonic acid, which breaks down into bicarbonate and hydrogen
ions. Carbaminohemoglobin is the bound form of hemoglobin and carbon
dioxide.
