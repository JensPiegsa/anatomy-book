<div data-type="abstract" markdown="1">
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Define the different types of body movements
* Identify the joints that allow for these motions

</div>
Synovial joints allow the body a tremendous range of movements. Each
movement at a synovial joint results from the contraction or relaxation
of the muscles that are attached to the bones on either side of the
articulation. The type of movement that can be produced at a synovial
joint is determined by its structural type. While the ball-and-socket
joint gives the greatest range of movement at an individual joint, in
other regions of the body, several joints may work together to produce a
particular movement. Overall, each type of synovial joint is necessary
to provide the body with its great flexibility and mobility. There are
many types of movement that can occur at synovial joints
([\[link\]](#tbl-ch09_01){: .autogenerated-content}). Movement types are
generally paired, with one being the opposite of the other. Body
movements are always described in relation to the anatomical position of
the body: upright stance, with upper limbs to the side of body and palms
facing forward. Refer to [\[link\]](#fig-ch09_05_01){:
.autogenerated-content} as you go through this section.

Movements of the Body, Part 1

<figcaption>
Synovial joints give the body many ways in which to move. (a)–(b)
Flexion and extension motions are in the sagittal (anterior–posterior)
plane of motion. These movements take place at the shoulder, hip, elbow,
knee, wrist, metacarpophalangeal, metatarsophalangeal, and
interphalangeal joints. (c)–(d) Anterior bending of the head or
vertebral column is flexion, while any posterior-going movement is
extension. (e) Abduction and adduction are motions of the limbs, hand,
fingers, or toes in the coronal (medial–lateral) plane of movement.
Moving the limb or hand laterally away from the body, or spreading the
fingers or toes, is abduction. Adduction brings the limb or hand toward
or across the midline of the body, or brings the fingers or toes
together. Circumduction is the movement of the limb, hand, or fingers in
a circular pattern, using the sequential combination of flexion,
adduction, extension, and abduction motions. Adduction/abduction and
circumduction take place at the shoulder, hip, wrist,
metacarpophalangeal, and metatarsophalangeal joints. (f) Turning of the
head side to side or twisting of the body is rotation. Medial and
lateral rotation of the upper limb at the shoulder or lower limb at the
hip involves turning the anterior surface of the limb toward the midline
of the body (medial or internal rotation) or away from the midline
(lateral or external rotation).

# Flexion and Extension
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Flexion</span> and <span
data-type="term">extension</span> are movements that take place within
the sagittal plane and involve anterior or posterior movements of the
body or limbs. For the vertebral column, flexion (anterior flexion) is
an anterior (forward) bending of the neck or body, while extension
involves a posterior-directed motion, such as straightening from a
flexed position or bending backward. <span data-type="term">Lateral
flexion</span> is the bending of the neck or body toward the right or
left side. These movements of the vertebral column involve both the
symphysis joint formed by each intervertebral disc, as well as the plane
type of synovial joint formed between the inferior articular processes
of one vertebra and the superior articular processes of the next lower
vertebra.
{: #fs-id1469460}

In the limbs, flexion decreases the angle between the bones (bending of
the joint), while extension increases the angle and straightens the
joint. For the upper limb, all anterior-going motions are flexion and
all posterior-going motions are extension. These include
anterior-posterior movements of the arm at the shoulder, the forearm at
the elbow, the hand at the wrist, and the fingers at the
metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. For the thumb, extension
moves the thumb away from the palm of the hand, within the same plane as
the palm, while flexion brings the thumb back against the index finger
or into the palm. These motions take place at the first carpometacarpal
joint. In the lower limb, bringing the thigh forward and upward is
flexion at the hip joint, while any posterior-going motion of the thigh
is extension. Note that extension of the thigh beyond the anatomical
(standing) position is greatly limited by the ligaments that support the
hip joint. Knee flexion is the bending of the knee to bring the foot
toward the posterior thigh, and extension is the straightening of the
knee. Flexion and extension movements are seen at the hinge, condyloid,
saddle, and ball-and-socket joints of the limbs (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch09_05_01){: .autogenerated-content}**a-d**{:
data-effect="bold"}).
{: #fs-id2227353}

<span data-type="term">Hyperextension</span> is the abnormal or
excessive extension of a joint beyond its normal range of motion, thus
resulting in injury. Similarly, <span
data-type="term">hyperflexion</span> is excessive flexion at a joint.
Hyperextension injuries are common at hinge joints such as the knee or
elbow. In cases of “whiplash” in which the head is suddenly moved
backward and then forward, a patient may experience both hyperextension
and hyperflexion of the cervical region.

# Abduction and Adduction
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Abduction</span> and <span
data-type="term">adduction</span> motions occur within the coronal plane
and involve medial-lateral motions of the limbs, fingers, toes, or
thumb. Abduction moves the limb laterally away from the midline of the
body, while adduction is the opposing movement that brings the limb
toward the body or across the midline. For example, abduction is raising
the arm at the shoulder joint, moving it laterally away from the body,
while adduction brings the arm down to the side of the body. Similarly,
abduction and adduction at the wrist moves the hand away from or toward
the midline of the body. Spreading the fingers or toes apart is also
abduction, while bringing the fingers or toes together is adduction. For
the thumb, abduction is the anterior movement that brings the thumb to a
90° perpendicular position, pointing straight out from the palm.
Adduction moves the thumb back to the anatomical position, next to the
index finger. Abduction and adduction movements are seen at condyloid,
saddle, and ball-and-socket joints (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch09_05_01){:
.autogenerated-content}**e**{: data-effect="bold"}).

# Circumduction
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Circumduction</span> is the movement of a body
region in a circular manner, in which one end of the body region being
moved stays relatively stationary while the other end describes a
circle. It involves the sequential combination of flexion, adduction,
extension, and abduction at a joint. This type of motion is found at
biaxial condyloid and saddle joints, and at multiaxial ball-and-sockets
joints (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch09_05_01){: .autogenerated-content}**e**{:
data-effect="bold"}).

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1478275" markdown="1">
# Rotation
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Rotation</span> can occur within the vertebral
column, at a pivot joint, or at a ball-and-socket joint. Rotation of the
neck or body is the twisting movement produced by the summation of the
small rotational movements available between adjacent vertebrae. At a
pivot joint, one bone rotates in relation to another bone. This is a
uniaxial joint, and thus rotation is the only motion allowed at a pivot
joint. For example, at the atlantoaxial joint, the first cervical (C1)
vertebra (atlas) rotates around the dens, the upward projection from the
second cervical (C2) vertebra (axis). This allows the head to rotate
from side to side as when shaking the head “no.” The proximal radioulnar
joint is a pivot joint formed by the head of the radius and its
articulation with the ulna. This joint allows for the radius to rotate
along its length during pronation and supination movements of the
forearm.
{: #fs-id1401596}

Rotation can also occur at the ball-and-socket joints of the shoulder
and hip. Here, the humerus and femur rotate around their long axis,
which moves the anterior surface of the arm or thigh either toward or
away from the midline of the body. Movement that brings the anterior
surface of the limb toward the midline of the body is called <span
data-type="term">medial (internal) rotation</span>. Conversely, rotation
of the limb so that the anterior surface moves away from the midline is
<span data-type="term">lateral (external) rotation</span> (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch09_05_01){: .autogenerated-content}**f**{:
data-effect="bold"}). Be sure to distinguish medial and lateral
rotation, which can only occur at the multiaxial shoulder and hip
joints, from circumduction, which can occur at either biaxial or
multiaxial joints.

# Supination and Pronation
{: data-type="title"}

Supination and pronation are movements of the forearm. In the anatomical
position, the upper limb is held next to the body with the palm facing
forward. This is the <span data-type="term">supinated position</span> of
the forearm. In this position, the radius and ulna are parallel to each
other. When the palm of the hand faces backward, the forearm is in the
<span data-type="term">pronated position</span>, and the radius and ulna
form an X-shape.
{: #fs-id1547390}

Supination and pronation are the movements of the forearm that go
between these two positions. <span data-type="term">Pronation</span> is
the motion that moves the forearm from the supinated (anatomical)
position to the pronated (palm backward) position. This motion is
produced by rotation of the radius at the proximal radioulnar joint,
accompanied by movement of the radius at the distal radioulnar joint.
The proximal radioulnar joint is a pivot joint that allows for rotation
of the head of the radius. Because of the slight curvature of the shaft
of the radius, this rotation causes the distal end of the radius to
cross over the distal ulna at the distal radioulnar joint. This crossing
over brings the radius and ulna into an X-shape position. <span
data-type="term">Supination</span> is the opposite motion, in which
rotation of the radius returns the bones to their parallel positions and
moves the palm to the anterior facing (supinated) position. It helps to
remember that supination is the motion you use when scooping up soup
with a spoon (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch09_05_02){:

# Dorsiflexion and Plantar Flexion
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Dorsiflexion</span> and <span
data-type="term">plantar flexion</span> are movements at the ankle
joint, which is a hinge joint. Lifting the front of the foot, so that
the top of the foot moves toward the anterior leg is dorsiflexion, while
lifting the heel of the foot from the ground or pointing the toes
downward is plantar flexion. These are the only movements available at
the ankle joint (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch09_05_02){:

# Inversion and Eversion
{: data-type="title"}

Inversion and eversion are complex movements that involve the multiple
plane joints among the tarsal bones of the posterior foot (intertarsal
joints) and thus are not motions that take place at the ankle joint.
<span data-type="term">Inversion</span> is the turning of the foot to
angle the bottom of the foot toward the midline, while <span
data-type="term">eversion</span> turns the bottom of the foot away from
the midline. The foot has a greater range of inversion than eversion
motion. These are important motions that help to stabilize the foot when
walking or running on an uneven surface and aid in the quick
side-to-side changes in direction used during active sports such as
basketball, racquetball, or soccer (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch09_05_02){:

# Protraction and Retraction
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Protraction</span> and <span
data-type="term">retraction</span> are anterior-posterior movements of
the scapula or mandible. Protraction of the scapula occurs when the
shoulder is moved forward, as when pushing against something or throwing
a ball. Retraction is the opposite motion, with the scapula being pulled
posteriorly and medially, toward the vertebral column. For the mandible,
protraction occurs when the lower jaw is pushed forward, to stick out
the chin, while retraction pulls the lower jaw backward. (See

<span data-type="term">Depression</span> and <span

the scapula or mandible. The upward movement of the scapula and shoulder
is elevation, while a downward movement is depression. These movements
are used to shrug your shoulders. Similarly, elevation of the mandible
is the upward movement of the lower jaw used to close the mouth or bite
on something, and depression is the downward movement that produces
opening of the mouth (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch09_05_02){:

# Superior Rotation and Inferior Rotation
{: data-type="title"}

Superior and inferior rotation are movements of the scapula and are
defined by the direction of movement of the glenoid cavity. These
motions involve rotation of the scapula around a point inferior to the
scapular spine and are produced by combinations of muscles acting on the
scapula. During <span data-type="term">superior rotation</span>, the
glenoid cavity moves upward as the medial end of the scapular spine
moves downward. This is a very important motion that contributes to
upper limb abduction. Without superior rotation of the scapula, the
greater tubercle of the humerus would hit the acromion of the scapula,
thus preventing any abduction of the arm above shoulder height. Superior
rotation of the scapula is thus required for full abduction of the upper
limb. Superior rotation is also used without arm abduction when carrying
a heavy load with your hand or on your shoulder. You can feel this
rotation when you pick up a load, such as a heavy book bag and carry it
on only one shoulder. To increase its weight-bearing support for the
bag, the shoulder lifts as the scapula superiorly rotates. <span
data-type="term">Inferior rotation</span> occurs during limb adduction
and involves the downward motion of the glenoid cavity with upward
movement of the medial end of the scapular spine.

# Opposition and Reposition
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Opposition</span> is the thumb movement that
brings the tip of the thumb in contact with the tip of a finger. This
movement is produced at the first carpometacarpal joint, which is a
saddle joint formed between the trapezium carpal bone and the first
metacarpal bone. Thumb opposition is produced by a combination of
flexion and abduction of the thumb at this joint. Returning the thumb to
its anatomical position next to the index finger is called <span

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The variety of movements provided by the different types of synovial
joints allows for a large range of body motions and gives you tremendous
mobility. These movements allow you to flex or extend your body or
limbs, medially rotate and adduct your arms and flex your elbows to hold
a heavy object against your chest, raise your arms above your head,
rotate or shake your head, and bend to touch the toes (with or without
bending your knees).
{: #fs-id2268643}

Each of the different structural types of synovial joints also allow for
specific motions. The atlantoaxial pivot joint provides side-to-side
rotation of the head, while the proximal radioulnar articulation allows
for rotation of the radius during pronation and supination of the
forearm. Hinge joints, such as at the knee and elbow, allow only for
flexion and extension. Similarly, the hinge joint of the ankle only
allows for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot.
{: #fs-id1921793}

Condyloid and saddle joints are biaxial. These allow for flexion and
extension, and abduction and adduction. The sequential combination of
flexion, adduction, extension, and abduction produces circumduction.
Multiaxial plane joints provide for only small motions, but these can
add together over several adjacent joints to produce body movement, such
as inversion and eversion of the foot. Similarly, plane joints allow for
flexion, extension, and lateral flexion movements of the vertebral
column. The multiaxial ball and socket joints allow for
flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, and circumduction. In addition,
these also allow for medial (internal) and lateral (external) rotation.
Ball-and-socket joints have the greatest range of motion of all synovial
joints.
