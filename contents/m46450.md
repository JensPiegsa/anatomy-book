When most people think of muscles, they think of the muscles that are
visible just under the skin, particularly of the limbs. These are
skeletal muscles, so-named because most of them move the skeleton. But
there are two other types of muscle in the body, with distinctly
different jobs. Cardiac muscle, found in the heart, is concerned with
pumping blood through the circulatory system. Smooth muscle is concerned
with various involuntary movements, such as having oneâ€™s hair stand on
end when cold or frightened, or moving food through the digestive
system. This chapter will examine the structure and function of these
three types of muscles.
