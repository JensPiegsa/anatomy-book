The picture you have in your mind of the nervous system probably
includes the <span data-type="term">brain</span>, the nervous tissue
contained within the cranium, and the <span data-type="term">spinal
cord</span>, the extension of nervous tissue within the vertebral
column. That suggests it is made of two organs—and you may not even
think of the spinal cord as an organ—but the nervous system is a very
complex structure. Within the brain, many different and separate regions
are responsible for many different and separate functions. It is as if
the nervous system is composed of many organs that all look similar and
can only be differentiated using tools such as the microscope or
electrophysiology. In comparison, it is easy to see that the stomach is
different than the esophagus or the liver, so you can imagine the
digestive system as a collection of specific organs.

# The Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems
{: data-type="title"}

The nervous system can be divided into two major regions: the central
and peripheral nervous systems. The <span data-type="term">central
nervous system (CNS)</span> is the brain and spinal cord, and the <span
data-type="term">peripheral nervous system (PNS)</span> is everything
else ([\[link\]](#fig-ch12_01_01){: .autogenerated-content}). The brain
is contained within the cranial cavity of the skull, and the spinal cord
is contained within the vertebral cavity of the vertebral column. It is
a bit of an oversimplification to say that the CNS is what is inside
these two cavities and the peripheral nervous system is outside of them,
but that is one way to start to think about it. In actuality, there are
some elements of the peripheral nervous system that are within the
cranial or vertebral cavities. The peripheral nervous system is so named
because it is on the periphery—meaning beyond the brain and spinal cord.
Depending on different aspects of the nervous system, the dividing line
between central and peripheral is not necessarily universal.

Nervous tissue, present in both the CNS and PNS, contains two basic
types of cells: neurons and glial cells. A <span data-type="term">glial
cell</span> is one of a variety of cells that provide a framework of
tissue that supports the neurons and their activities. The <span
data-type="term">neuron</span> is the more functionally important of the
two, in terms of the communicative function of the nervous system. To
describe the functional divisions of the nervous system, it is important
to understand the structure of a neuron. Neurons are cells and therefore
have a <span data-type="term">soma</span>, or cell body, but they also
have extensions of the cell; each extension is generally referred to as
a <span data-type="term">process</span>. There is one important process
that every neuron has called an <span data-type="term">axon</span>,
which is the fiber that connects a neuron with its target. Another type
of process that branches off from the soma is the <span
data-type="term">dendrite</span>. Dendrites are responsible for
receiving most of the input from other neurons. Looking at nervous
tissue, there are regions that predominantly contain cell bodies and
regions that are largely composed of just axons. These two regions
within nervous system structures are often referred to as <span
data-type="term">gray matter</span> (the regions with many cell bodies
and dendrites) or <span data-type="term">white matter</span> (the
regions with many axons). [\[link\]](#fig-ch12_01_02){:
.autogenerated-content} demonstrates the appearance of these regions in
the brain and spinal cord. The colors ascribed to these regions are what
would be seen in “fresh,” or unstained, nervous tissue. Gray matter is
not necessarily gray. It can be pinkish because of blood content, or
even slightly tan, depending on how long the tissue has been preserved.
But white matter is white because axons are insulated by a lipid-rich
substance called <span data-type="term">myelin</span>. Lipids can appear
as white (“fatty”) material, much like the fat on a raw piece of chicken
or beef. Actually, gray matter may have that color ascribed to it
because next to the white matter, it is just darker—hence, gray.
{: #fs-id2151899}

The distinction between gray matter and white matter is most often
applied to central nervous tissue, which has large regions that can be
seen with the unaided eye. When looking at peripheral structures, often
a microscope is used and the tissue is stained with artificial colors.
That is not to say that central nervous tissue cannot be stained and
viewed under a microscope, but unstained tissue is most likely from the
CNS—for example, a frontal section of the brain or cross section of the
spinal cord.

Regardless of the appearance of stained or unstained tissue, the cell
bodies of neurons or axons can be located in discrete anatomical
structures that need to be named. Those names are specific to whether
the structure is central or peripheral. A localized collection of neuron
cell bodies in the CNS is referred to as a <span
data-type="term">nucleus</span>. In the PNS, a cluster of neuron cell
bodies is referred to as a <span data-type="term">ganglion</span>.
[\[link\]](#fig-ch12_01_03){: .autogenerated-content} indicates how the
term nucleus has a few different meanings within anatomy and physiology.
It is the center of an atom, where protons and neutrons are found; it is
the center of a cell, where the DNA is found; and it is a center of some
function in the CNS. There is also a potentially confusing use of the
word ganglion (plural = ganglia) that has a historical explanation. In
the central nervous system, there is a group of nuclei that are
connected together and were once called the basal ganglia before
“ganglion” became accepted as a description for a peripheral structure.
Some sources refer to this group of nuclei as the “basal nuclei” to
avoid confusion.

Terminology applied to bundles of axons also differs depending on
location. A bundle of axons, or fibers, found in the CNS is called a
<span data-type="term">tract</span> whereas the same thing in the PNS
would be called a <span data-type="term">nerve</span>. There is an
important point to make about these terms, which is that they can both
be used to refer to the same bundle of axons. When those axons are in
the PNS, the term is nerve, but if they are CNS, the term is tract. The
most obvious example of this is the axons that project from the retina
into the brain. Those axons are called the optic nerve as they leave the
eye, but when they are inside the cranium, they are referred to as the
optic tract. There is a specific place where the name changes, which is
the optic chiasm, but they are still the same axons
([\[link\]](#fig-ch12_01_04){: .autogenerated-content}). A similar
situation outside of science can be described for some roads. Imagine a
road called “Broad Street” in a town called “Anyville.” The road leaves
Anyville and goes to the next town over, called “Hometown.” When the
road crosses the line between the two towns and is in Hometown, its name
changes to “Main Street.” That is the idea behind the naming of the
retinal axons. In the PNS, they are called the optic nerve, and in the
CNS, they are the optic tract. [\[link\]](#tbl-ch12_01){:
.autogenerated-content} helps to clarify which of these terms apply to
the central or peripheral nervous systems.

In 2003, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Paul
C. Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield for discoveries related to magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). This is a tool to see the structures of the
body (not just the nervous system) that depends on magnetic fields
associated with certain atomic nuclei. The utility of this technique in
the nervous system is that fat tissue and water appear as different
shades between black and white. Because white matter is fatty (from
myelin) and gray matter is not, they can be easily distinguished in MRI
images. Visit the Nobel Prize [web site][1] to play an interactive game
that demonstrates the use of this technology and compares it with other
types of imaging technologies. Also, the results from an MRI session are
compared with images obtained from X-ray or computed tomography. How do
the imaging techniques shown in this game indicate the separation of
white and gray matter compared with the freshly dissected tissue shown
earlier?

# Functional Divisions of the Nervous System
{: data-type="title"}

The nervous system can also be divided on the basis of its functions,
but anatomical divisions and functional divisions are different. The CNS
and the PNS both contribute to the same functions, but those functions
can be attributed to different regions of the brain (such as the
cerebral cortex or the hypothalamus) or to different ganglia in the
periphery. The problem with trying to fit functional differences into
anatomical divisions is that sometimes the same structure can be part of
several functions. For example, the optic nerve carries signals from the
retina that are either used for the conscious perception of visual
stimuli, which takes place in the cerebral cortex, or for the reflexive
responses of smooth muscle tissue that are processed through the
hypothalamus.
{: #fs-id1701704}

There are two ways to consider how the nervous system is divided
functionally. First, the basic functions of the nervous system are
sensation, integration, and response. Secondly, control of the body can
be somatic or autonomic—divisions that are largely defined by the
structures that are involved in the response. There is also a region of
the peripheral nervous system that is called the enteric nervous system
that is responsible for a specific set of the functions within the realm
of autonomic control related to gastrointestinal functions.
{: #fs-id2009921}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1480173" markdown="1">
## Basic Functions
{: data-type="title"}

The nervous system is involved in receiving information about the
environment around us (sensation) and generating responses to that
information (motor responses). The nervous system can be divided into
regions that are responsible for <span data-type="term">sensation</span>
(sensory functions) and for the <span data-type="term">response</span>
(motor functions). But there is a third function that needs to be
included. Sensory input needs to be integrated with other sensations, as
well as with memories, emotional state, or learning (cognition). Some
regions of the nervous system are termed <span
data-type="term">integration</span> or association areas. The process of
integration combines sensory perceptions and higher cognitive functions
such as memories, learning, and emotion to produce a response.
{: #fs-id1390772}

*Sensation.*{: data-effect="italics"} The first major function of the
nervous system is sensation—receiving information about the environment
to gain input about what is happening outside the body (or, sometimes,
within the body). The sensory functions of the nervous system register
the presence of a change from homeostasis or a particular event in the
environment, known as a <span data-type="term">stimulus</span>. The
senses we think of most are the “big five”\: taste, smell, touch, sight,
and hearing. The stimuli for taste and smell are both chemical
substances (molecules, compounds, ions, etc.), touch is physical or
mechanical stimuli that interact with the skin, sight is light stimuli,
and hearing is the perception of sound, which is a physical stimulus
similar to some aspects of touch. There are actually more senses than
just those, but that list represents the major senses. Those five are
all senses that receive stimuli from the outside world, and of which
there is conscious perception. Additional sensory stimuli might be from
the internal environment (inside the body), such as the stretch of an
organ wall or the concentration of certain ions in the blood.
{: #fs-id1352180}

*Response.*{: data-effect="italics"} The nervous system produces a
response on the basis of the stimuli perceived by sensory structures. An
obvious response would be the movement of muscles, such as withdrawing a
hand from a hot stove, but there are broader uses of the term. The
nervous system can cause the contraction of all three types of muscle
tissue. For example, skeletal muscle contracts to move the skeleton,
cardiac muscle is influenced as heart rate increases during exercise,
and smooth muscle contracts as the digestive system moves food along the
digestive tract. Responses also include the neural control of glands in
the body as well, such as the production and secretion of sweat by the
eccrine and merocrine sweat glands found in the skin to lower body
temperature.
{: #fs-id1405455}

Responses can be divided into those that are voluntary or conscious
(contraction of skeletal muscle) and those that are involuntary
(contraction of smooth muscles, regulation of cardiac muscle, activation
of glands). Voluntary responses are governed by the somatic nervous
system and involuntary responses are governed by the autonomic nervous
system, which are discussed in the next section.
{: #fs-id1421083}

*Integration.*{: data-effect="italics"} Stimuli that are received by
sensory structures are communicated to the nervous system where that
information is processed. This is called integration. Stimuli are
compared with, or integrated with, other stimuli, memories of previous
stimuli, or the state of a person at a particular time. This leads to
the specific response that will be generated. Seeing a baseball pitched
to a batter will not automatically cause the batter to swing. The
trajectory of the ball and its speed will need to be considered. Maybe
the count is three balls and one strike, and the batter wants to let
this pitch go by in the hope of getting a walk to first base. Or maybe
the batter’s team is so far ahead, it would be fun to just swing away.

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2754785" markdown="1">
## Controlling the Body
{: data-type="title"}

The nervous system can be divided into two parts mostly on the basis of
a functional difference in responses. The <span data-type="term">somatic
nervous system (SNS)</span> is responsible for conscious perception and
voluntary motor responses. Voluntary motor response means the
contraction of skeletal muscle, but those contractions are not always
voluntary in the sense that you have to want to perform them. Some
somatic motor responses are reflexes, and often happen without a
conscious decision to perform them. If your friend jumps out from behind
a corner and yells “Boo!” you will be startled and you might scream or
leap back. You didn’t decide to do that, and you may not have wanted to
give your friend a reason to laugh at your expense, but it is a reflex
involving skeletal muscle contractions. Other motor responses become
automatic (in other words, unconscious) as a person learns motor skills
(referred to as “habit learning” or “procedural memory”).
{: #fs-id1640652}

The <span data-type="term">autonomic nervous system (ANS)</span> is
responsible for involuntary control of the body, usually for the sake of
homeostasis (regulation of the internal environment). Sensory input for
autonomic functions can be from sensory structures tuned to external or
internal environmental stimuli. The motor output extends to smooth and
cardiac muscle as well as glandular tissue. The role of the autonomic
system is to regulate the organ systems of the body, which usually means
to control homeostasis. Sweat glands, for example, are controlled by the
autonomic system. When you are hot, sweating helps cool your body down.
That is a homeostatic mechanism. But when you are nervous, you might
start sweating also. That is not homeostatic, it is the physiological
response to an emotional state.
{: #fs-id2025833}

There is another division of the nervous system that describes
functional responses. The <span data-type="term">enteric nervous system
(ENS)</span> is responsible for controlling the smooth muscle and
glandular tissue in your digestive system. It is a large part of the
PNS, and is not dependent on the CNS. It is sometimes valid, however, to
consider the enteric system to be a part of the autonomic system because
the neural structures that make up the enteric system are a component of
the autonomic output that regulates digestion. There are some
differences between the two, but for our purposes here there will be a
good bit of overlap. See [\[link\]](#fig-ch12_01_05){:
.autogenerated-content} for examples of where these divisions of the
nervous system can be found.

Somatic structures include the spinal nerves, both motor and sensory

An easy way to see how much of the brain a person uses is to take
measurements of brain activity while performing a task. An example of
this kind of measurement is functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI), which generates a map of the most active areas and can be
generated and presented in three dimensions
([\[link\]](#fig-ch12_01_06){: .autogenerated-content}). This procedure
is different from the standard MRI technique because it is measuring
changes in the tissue in time with an experimental condition or event.

the center of the brain are also yellow. The two small areas are in the
same relative location but in opposite hemispheres of the

The underlying assumption is that active nervous tissue will have
greater blood flow. By having the subject perform a visual task,
activity all over the brain can be measured. Consider this possible
experiment: the subject is told to look at a screen with a black dot in
the middle (a fixation point). A photograph of a face is projected on
the screen away from the center. The subject has to look at the
photograph and decipher what it is. The subject has been instructed to
push a button if the photograph is of someone they recognize. The
photograph might be of a celebrity, so the subject would press the
button, or it might be of a random person unknown to the subject, so the
subject would not press the button.

In this task, visual sensory areas would be active, integrating areas
would be active, motor areas responsible for moving the eyes would be
active, and motor areas for pressing the button with a finger would be
active. Those areas are distributed all around the brain and the fMRI
images would show activity in more than just 10 percent of the brain
(some evidence suggests that about 80 percent of the brain is using
energy—based on blood flow to the tissue—during well-defined tasks
similar to the one suggested above). This task does not even include all
of the functions the brain performs. There is no language response, the
body is mostly lying still in the MRI machine, and it does not consider
the autonomic functions that would be ongoing in the background.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The nervous system can be separated into divisions on the basis of
anatomy and physiology. The anatomical divisions are the central and
peripheral nervous systems. The CNS is the brain and spinal cord. The
PNS is everything else. Functionally, the nervous system can be divided
into those regions that are responsible for sensation, those that are
responsible for integration, and those that are responsible for
generating responses. All of these functional areas are found in both
the central and peripheral anatomy.
{: #fs-id2295405}

Considering the anatomical regions of the nervous system, there are
specific names for the structures within each division. A localized
collection of neuron cell bodies is referred to as a nucleus in the CNS
and as a ganglion in the PNS. A bundle of axons is referred to as a
tract in the CNS and as a nerve in the PNS. Whereas nuclei and ganglia
are specifically in the central or peripheral divisions, axons can cross
the boundary between the two. A single axon can be part of a nerve and a
tract. The name for that specific structure depends on its location.
{: #fs-id805399}

Nervous tissue can also be described as gray matter and white matter on
the basis of its appearance in unstained tissue. These descriptions are
more often used in the CNS. Gray matter is where nuclei are found and
white matter is where tracts are found. In the PNS, ganglia are
basically gray matter and nerves are white matter.
{: #fs-id2170676}

The nervous system can also be divided on the basis of how it controls
the body. The somatic nervous system (SNS) is responsible for functions
that result in moving skeletal muscles. Any sensory or integrative
functions that result in the movement of skeletal muscle would be
considered somatic. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible
for functions that affect cardiac or smooth muscle tissue, or that cause
glands to produce their secretions. Autonomic functions are distributed
between central and peripheral regions of the nervous system. The
sensations that lead to autonomic functions can be the same sensations
that are part of initiating somatic responses. Somatic and autonomic
integrative functions may overlap as well.
{: #fs-id1921607}

A special division of the nervous system is the enteric nervous system,
which is responsible for controlling the digestive organs. Parts of the
autonomic nervous system overlap with the enteric nervous system. The
enteric nervous system is exclusively found in the periphery because it
is the nervous tissue in the organs of the digestive system.

In 2003, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Paul
C. Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield for discoveries related to magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). This is a tool to see the structures of the
body (not just the nervous system) that depends on magnetic fields
associated with certain atomic nuclei. The utility of this technique in
the nervous system is that fat tissue and water appear as different
shades between black and white. Because white matter is fatty (from
myelin) and gray matter is not, they can be easily distinguished in MRI
images. Visit the Nobel Prize [website][1] to play an interactive game
that demonstrates the use of this technology and compares it with other
types of imaging technologies. Also, the results from an MRI session are
compared with images obtained from x-ray or computed tomography. How do
the imaging techniques shown in this game indicate the separation of
white and gray matter compared with the freshly dissected tissue shown
earlier?

MRI uses the relative amount of water in tissue to distinguish different
areas, so gray and white matter in the nervous system can be seen
clearly in these images.

Visit this [site][2] to read about a woman that notices that her
daughter is having trouble walking up the stairs. This leads to the
discovery of a hereditary condition that affects the brain and spinal
cord. The electromyography and MRI tests indicated deficiencies in the
spinal cord and cerebellum, both of which are responsible for
controlling coordinated movements. To what functional division of the
nervous system would these structures belong?
