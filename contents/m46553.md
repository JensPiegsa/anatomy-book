<div data-type="abstract" markdown="1">
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Describe the structures found in the PNS
* Distinguish between somatic and autonomic structures, including the
  special peripheral structures of the enteric nervous system
* Name the twelve cranial nerves and explain the functions associated
  with each
* Describe the sensory and motor components of spinal nerves and the
  plexuses that they pass through

The PNS is not as contained as the CNS because it is defined as
everything that is not the CNS. Some peripheral structures are
incorporated into the other organs of the body. In describing the
anatomy of the PNS, it is necessary to describe the common structures,
the nerves and the ganglia, as they are found in various parts of the
body. Many of the neural structures that are incorporated into other
organs are features of the digestive system; these structures are known
as the <span data-type="term">enteric nervous system</span> and are a
special subset of the PNS.

# Ganglia
{: data-type="title"}

A ganglion is a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery. Ganglia
can be categorized, for the most part, as either sensory ganglia or
autonomic ganglia, referring to their primary functions. The most common
type of sensory ganglion is a <span data-type="term">dorsal (posterior)
root ganglion</span>. These ganglia are the cell bodies of neurons with
axons that are sensory endings in the periphery, such as in the skin,
and that extend into the CNS through the dorsal nerve root. The ganglion
is an enlargement of the nerve root. Under microscopic inspection, it
can be seen to include the cell bodies of the neurons, as well as
bundles of fibers that are the posterior nerve root
([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_04_01){: .autogenerated-content}). The cells of
the dorsal root ganglion are unipolar cells, classifying them by shape.
Also, the small round nuclei of satellite cells can be seen
surrounding—as if they were orbiting—the neuron cell bodies.

to explore the tissue sample in greater detail. If you zoom in on the
dorsal root ganglion, you can see smaller satellite glial cells
surrounding the large cell bodies of the sensory neurons. From what
structure do satellite cells derive during embryologic development?
{: #fs-id2055796}

</div>
Another type of sensory ganglion is a <span data-type="term">cranial
nerve ganglion</span>. This is analogous to the dorsal root ganglion,
except that it is associated with a <span data-type="term">cranial
nerve</span> instead of a <span data-type="term">spinal nerve</span>.
The roots of cranial nerves are within the cranium, whereas the ganglia
are outside the skull. For example, the <span
data-type="term">trigeminal ganglion</span> is superficial to the
temporal bone whereas its associated nerve is attached to the mid-pons
region of the brain stem. The neurons of cranial nerve ganglia are also
unipolar in shape with associated satellite cells.
{: #fs-id1334448}

The other major category of ganglia are those of the autonomic nervous
system, which is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous systems. The <span data-type="term">sympathetic chain
ganglia</span> constitute a row of ganglia along the vertebral column
that receive central input from the lateral horn of the thoracic and
upper lumbar spinal cord. Superior to the chain ganglia are three <span
data-type="term">paravertebral ganglia</span> in the cervical region.
Three other autonomic ganglia that are related to the sympathetic chain
are the <span data-type="term">prevertebral ganglia</span>, which are
located outside of the chain but have similar functions. They are
referred to as prevertebral because they are anterior to the vertebral
column. The neurons of these autonomic ganglia are multipolar in shape,
with dendrites radiating out around the cell body where synapses from
the spinal cord neurons are made. The neurons of the chain,
paravertebral, and prevertebral ganglia then project to organs in the
head and neck, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities to regulate the
sympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms.
{: #fs-id1553818}

Another group of autonomic ganglia are the <span
data-type="term">terminal ganglia</span> that receive input from cranial
nerves or sacral spinal nerves and are responsible for regulating the
parasympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms. These two sets of
ganglia, sympathetic and parasympathetic, often project to the same
organs—one input from the chain ganglia and one input from a terminal
ganglion—to regulate the overall function of an organ. For example, the
heart receives two inputs such as these; one increases heart rate, and
the other decreases it. The terminal ganglia that receive input from
cranial nerves are found in the head and neck, as well as the thoracic
and upper abdominal cavities, whereas the terminal ganglia that receive
sacral input are in the lower abdominal and pelvic cavities.
{: #fs-id1144493}

Terminal ganglia below the head and neck are often incorporated into the
wall of the target organ as a <span data-type="term">plexus</span>. A
plexus, in a general sense, is a network of fibers or vessels. This can
apply to nervous tissue (as in this instance) or structures containing
blood vessels (such as a choroid plexus). For example, the <span
data-type="term">enteric plexus</span> is the extensive network of axons
and neurons in the wall of the small and large intestines. The enteric
plexus is actually part of the enteric nervous system, along with the
<span data-type="term">gastric plexuses</span> and the <span
data-type="term">esophageal plexus</span>. Though the enteric nervous
system receives input originating from central neurons of the autonomic
nervous system, it does not require CNS input to function. In fact, it
operates independently to regulate the digestive system.

# Nerves
{: data-type="title"}

Bundles of axons in the PNS are referred to as nerves. These structures
in the periphery are different than the central counterpart, called a
tract. Nerves are composed of more than just nervous tissue. They have
connective tissues invested in their structure, as well as blood vessels
supplying the tissues with nourishment. The outer surface of a nerve is
a surrounding layer of fibrous connective tissue called the <span
data-type="term">epineurium</span>. Within the nerve, axons are further
bundled into <span data-type="term">fascicles</span>, which are each
surrounded by their own layer of fibrous connective tissue called <span
data-type="term">perineurium</span>. Finally, individual axons are
surrounded by loose connective tissue called the <span
data-type="term">endoneurium</span> ([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_04_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). These three layers are similar to the
connective tissue sheaths for muscles. Nerves are associated with the
region of the CNS to which they are connected, either as cranial nerves
connected to the brain or spinal nerves connected to the spinal cord.

## Cranial Nerves
{: data-type="title"}

The nerves attached to the brain are the cranial nerves, which are
primarily responsible for the sensory and motor functions of the head
and neck (one of these nerves targets organs in the thoracic and
abdominal cavities as part of the parasympathetic nervous system). There
are twelve cranial nerves, which are designated CNI through CNXII for
“Cranial Nerve,” using Roman numerals for 1 through 12. They can be
classified as sensory nerves, motor nerves, or a combination of both,
meaning that the axons in these nerves originate out of sensory ganglia
external to the cranium or motor nuclei within the brain stem. Sensory
axons enter the brain to synapse in a nucleus. Motor axons connect to
skeletal muscles of the head or neck. Three of the nerves are solely
composed of sensory fibers; five are strictly motor; and the remaining
four are mixed nerves.
{: #fs-id1490633}

Learning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses, and
students have always used mnemonic devices to remember the nerve names.
A traditional mnemonic is the rhyming couplet, “On Old Olympus’ Towering
Tops/A Finn And German Viewed Some Hops,” in which the initial letter of
each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name of each nerve.
The names of the nerves have changed over the years to reflect current
usage and more accurate naming. An exercise to help learn this sort of
information is to generate a mnemonic using words that have personal
significance. The names of the cranial nerves are listed in
[\[link\]](#tbl-ch13_03){: .autogenerated-content} along with a brief
description of their function, their source (sensory ganglion or motor
nucleus), and their target (sensory nucleus or skeletal muscle). They
are listed here with a brief explanation of each nerve
([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_04_05){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1107187}

The <span data-type="term">olfactory nerve</span> and <span
data-type="term">optic nerve</span> are responsible for the sense of
smell and vision, respectively. The <span data-type="term">oculomotor
nerve</span> is responsible for eye movements by controlling four of the
<span data-type="term">extraocular muscles</span>. It is also
responsible for lifting the upper eyelid when the eyes point up, and for
pupillary constriction. The <span data-type="term">trochlear
nerve</span> and the <span data-type="term">abducens nerve</span> are
both responsible for eye movement, but do so by controlling different
extraocular muscles. The <span data-type="term">trigeminal nerve</span>
is responsible for cutaneous sensations of the face and controlling the
muscles of mastication. The <span data-type="term">facial nerve</span>
is responsible for the muscles involved in facial expressions, as well
as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva. The <span
data-type="term">vestibulocochlear nerve</span> is responsible for the
senses of hearing and balance. The <span
data-type="term">glossopharyngeal nerve</span> is responsible for
controlling muscles in the oral cavity and upper throat, as well as part
of the sense of taste and the production of saliva. The <span
data-type="term">vagus nerve</span> is responsible for contributing to
homeostatic control of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal
cavities. The <span data-type="term">spinal accessory nerve</span> is
responsible for controlling the muscles of the neck, along with cervical
spinal nerves. The <span data-type="term">hypoglossal nerve</span> is
responsible for controlling the muscles of the lower throat and tongue.

Three of the cranial nerves also contain autonomic fibers, and a fourth
is almost purely a component of the autonomic system. The oculomotor,
facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves contain fibers that contact
autonomic ganglia. The oculomotor fibers initiate pupillary
constriction, whereas the facial and glossopharyngeal fibers both
initiate salivation. The vagus nerve primarily targets autonomic ganglia
in the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities.

Visit this [site][3] to read about a man who wakes with a headache and a
loss of vision. His regular doctor sent him to an ophthalmologist to
address the vision loss. The ophthalmologist recognizes a greater
problem and immediately sends him to the emergency room. Once there, the
patient undergoes a large battery of tests, but a definite cause cannot
be found. A specialist recognizes the problem as meningitis, but the
question is what caused it originally. How can that be cured? The loss
of vision comes from swelling around the optic nerve, which probably
presented as a bulge on the inside of the eye. Why is swelling related
to meningitis going to push on the optic nerve?
{: #fs-id1533637}

</div>
Another important aspect of the cranial nerves that lends itself to a
mnemonic is the functional role each nerve plays. The nerves fall into
one of three basic groups. They are sensory, motor, or both (see
[\[link\]](#tbl-ch13_03){: .autogenerated-content}). The sentence, “Some
Say Marry Money But My Brother Says Brains Beauty Matter More,”
corresponds to the basic function of each nerve. The first, second, and
eighth nerves are purely sensory: the olfactory (CNI), optic (CNII), and
vestibulocochlear (CNVIII) nerves. The three eye-movement nerves are all
motor: the oculomotor (CNIII), trochlear (CNIV), and abducens (CNVI).
The spinal accessory (CNXI) and hypoglossal (CNXII) nerves are also
strictly motor. The remainder of the nerves contain both sensory and
motor fibers. They are the trigeminal (CNV), facial (CNVII),
glossopharyngeal (CNIX), and vagus (CNX) nerves. The nerves that convey
both are often related to each other. The trigeminal and facial nerves
both concern the face; one concerns the sensations and the other
concerns the muscle movements. The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves
are both responsible for conveying gustatory, or taste, sensations as
well as controlling salivary glands. The vagus nerve is involved in
visceral responses to taste, namely the gag reflex. This is not an
exhaustive list of what these combination nerves do, but there is a
thread of relation between them.

## Spinal Nerves
{: data-type="title"}

The nerves connected to the spinal cord are the spinal nerves. The
arrangement of these nerves is much more regular than that of the
cranial nerves. All of the spinal nerves are combined sensory and motor
axons that separate into two nerve roots. The sensory axons enter the
spinal cord as the dorsal nerve root. The motor fibers, both somatic and
autonomic, emerge as the ventral nerve root. The dorsal root ganglion
for each nerve is an enlargement of the spinal nerve.
{: #fs-id1119780}

There are 31 spinal nerves, named for the level of the spinal cord at
which each one emerges. There are eight pairs of cervical nerves
designated C1 to C8, twelve thoracic nerves designated T1 to T12, five
pairs of lumbar nerves designated L1 to L5, five pairs of sacral nerves
designated S1 to S5, and one pair of coccygeal nerves. The nerves are
numbered from the superior to inferior positions, and each emerges from
the vertebral column through the intervertebral foramen at its level.
The first nerve, C1, emerges between the first cervical vertebra and the
occipital bone. The second nerve, C2, emerges between the first and
second cervical vertebrae. The same occurs for C3 to C7, but C8 emerges
between the seventh cervical vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra.
For the thoracic and lumbar nerves, each one emerges between the
vertebra that has the same designation and the next vertebra in the
column. The sacral nerves emerge from the sacral foramina along the
length of that unique vertebra.
{: #fs-id1119463}

Spinal nerves extend outward from the vertebral column to enervate the
periphery. The nerves in the periphery are not straight continuations of
the spinal nerves, but rather the reorganization of the axons in those
nerves to follow different courses. Axons from different spinal nerves
will come together into a <span data-type="term">systemic nerve</span>.
This occurs at four places along the length of the vertebral column,
each identified as a <span data-type="term">nerve plexus</span>, whereas
the other spinal nerves directly correspond to nerves at their
respective levels. In this instance, the word plexus is used to describe
networks of nerve fibers with no associated cell bodies.
{: #fs-id1196887}

Of the four nerve plexuses, two are found at the cervical level, one at
the lumbar level, and one at the sacral level
([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_04_06){: .autogenerated-content}). The <span
data-type="term">cervical plexus</span> is composed of axons from spinal
nerves C1 through C5 and branches into nerves in the posterior neck and
head, as well as the <span data-type="term">phrenic nerve</span>, which
connects to the diaphragm at the base of the thoracic cavity. The other
plexus from the cervical level is the <span data-type="term">brachial
plexus</span>. Spinal nerves C4 through T1 reorganize through this
plexus to give rise to the nerves of the arms, as the name brachial
suggests. A large nerve from this plexus is the <span
data-type="term">radial nerve</span> from which the <span
data-type="term">axillary nerve</span> branches to go to the armpit
region. The radial nerve continues through the arm and is paralleled by
the <span data-type="term">ulnar nerve</span> and the <span
data-type="term">median nerve</span>. The <span data-type="term">lumbar
plexus</span> arises from all the lumbar spinal nerves and gives rise to
nerves enervating the pelvic region and the anterior leg. The <span
data-type="term">femoral nerve</span> is one of the major nerves from
this plexus, which gives rise to the <span data-type="term">saphenous
nerve</span> as a branch that extends through the anterior lower leg.
The <span data-type="term">sacral plexus</span> comes from the lower
lumbar nerves L4 and L5 and the sacral nerves S1 to S4. The most
significant systemic nerve to come from this plexus is the <span
data-type="term">sciatic nerve</span>, which is a combination of the
<span data-type="term">tibial nerve</span> and the <span
data-type="term">fibular nerve</span>. The sciatic nerve extends across
the hip joint and is most commonly associated with the condition <span
data-type="term">sciatica</span>, which is the result of compression or
irritation of the nerve or any of the spinal nerves giving rise to it.
{: #fs-id1472046}

These plexuses are described as arising from spinal nerves and giving
rise to certain systemic nerves, but they contain fibers that serve
sensory functions or fibers that serve motor functions. This means that
some fibers extend from cutaneous or other peripheral sensory surfaces
and send action potentials into the CNS. Those are axons of sensory
neurons in the dorsal root ganglia that enter the spinal cord through
the dorsal nerve root. Other fibers are the axons of motor neurons of
the anterior horn of the spinal cord, which emerge in the ventral nerve
root and send action potentials to cause skeletal muscles to contract in
their target regions. For example, the radial nerve contains fibers of
cutaneous sensation in the arm, as well as motor fibers that move
muscles in the arm.
{: #fs-id1064165}

Spinal nerves of the thoracic region, T2 through T11, are not part of
the plexuses but rather emerge and give rise to the <span
data-type="term">intercostal nerves</span> found between the ribs, which
articulate with the vertebrae surrounding the spinal nerve.

Aging and the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Nervous System</span> Anosmia is the loss of the
sense of smell. It is often the result of the olfactory nerve being
severed, usually because of blunt force trauma to the head. The sensory
neurons of the olfactory epithelium have a limited lifespan of
approximately one to four months, and new ones are made on a regular
basis. The new neurons extend their axons into the CNS by growing along
the existing fibers of the olfactory nerve. The ability of these neurons
to be replaced is lost with age. Age-related anosmia is not the result
of impact trauma to the head, but rather a slow loss of the sensory
neurons with no new neurons born to replace them.
{: #fs-id1521213}

Smell is an important sense, especially for the enjoyment of food. There
are only five tastes sensed by the tongue, and two of them are generally
thought of as unpleasant tastes (sour and bitter). The rich sensory
experience of food is the result of odor molecules associated with the
food, both as food is moved into the mouth, and therefore passes under
the nose, and when it is chewed and molecules are released to move up
the pharynx into the posterior nasal cavity. Anosmia results in a loss
of the enjoyment of food.
{: #fs-id1258027}

As the replacement of olfactory neurons declines with age, anosmia can
set in. Without the sense of smell, many sufferers complain of food
tasting bland. Often, the only way to enjoy food is to add seasoning
that can be sensed on the tongue, which usually means adding table salt.
The problem with this solution, however, is that this increases sodium

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The PNS is composed of the groups of neurons (ganglia) and bundles of
axons (nerves) that are outside of the brain and spinal cord. Ganglia
are of two types, sensory or autonomic. Sensory ganglia contain unipolar
sensory neurons and are found on the dorsal root of all spinal nerves as
well as associated with many of the cranial nerves. Autonomic ganglia
are in the sympathetic chain, the associated paravertebral or
prevertebral ganglia, or in terminal ganglia near or within the organs
controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

Nerves are classified as cranial nerves or spinal nerves on the basis of
their connection to the brain or spinal cord, respectively. The twelve
cranial nerves can be strictly sensory in function, strictly motor in
function, or a combination of the two functions. Sensory fibers are
axons of sensory ganglia that carry sensory information into the brain
and target sensory nuclei. Motor fibers are axons of motor neurons in
motor nuclei of the brain stem and target skeletal muscles of the head
and neck. Spinal nerves are all mixed nerves with both sensory and motor
fibers. Spinal nerves emerge from the spinal cord and reorganize through
plexuses, which then give rise to systemic nerves. Thoracic spinal
nerves are not part of any plexus, but give rise to the intercostal
nerves directly.

Visit this [site][3] to read about a man who wakes with a headache and a
loss of vision. His regular doctor sent him to an ophthalmologist to
address the vision loss. The ophthalmologist recognizes a greater
problem and immediately sends him to the emergency room. Once there, the
patient undergoes a large battery of tests, but a definite cause cannot
be found. A specialist recognizes the problem as meningitis, but the
question is what caused it originally. How can that be cured? The loss
of vision comes from swelling around the optic nerve, which probably
presented as a bulge on the inside of the eye. Why is swelling related
to meningitis going to push on the optic nerve?

<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1641271" data-label="" markdown="1">
The optic nerve enters the CNS in its projection from the eyes in the
periphery, which means that it crosses through the meninges. Meningitis
will include swelling of those protective layers of the CNS, resulting
in pressure on the optic nerve, which can compromise vision.

The peripheral nervous tissues are out in the body, sometimes part of
other organ systems. There is not a privileged blood supply like there
is to the brain and spinal cord, so peripheral nervous tissues do not
need the same sort of protections.
