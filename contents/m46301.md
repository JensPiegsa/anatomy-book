In the early stages of embryonic development, the embryo’s skeleton
consists of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. By the sixth or
seventh week of embryonic life, the actual process of bone development,
<span data-type="term">ossification</span> (osteogenesis), begins. There
are two osteogenic pathways—intramembranous ossification and
endochondral ossification—but bone is the same regardless of the pathway
that produces it.

# Cartilage Templates
{: data-type="title"}

Bone is a replacement tissue; that is, it uses a model tissue on which
to lay down its mineral matrix. For skeletal development, the most
common template is cartilage. During fetal development, a framework is
laid down that determines where bones will form. This framework is a
flexible, semi-solid matrix produced by chondroblasts and consists of
hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, collagen fibers, and water. As the
matrix surrounds and isolates chondroblasts, they are called
chondrocytes. Unlike most connective tissues, cartilage is avascular,
meaning that it has no blood vessels supplying nutrients and removing
metabolic wastes. All of these functions are carried on by diffusion
through the matrix. This is why damaged cartilage does not repair itself
as readily as most tissues do.
{: #fs-id1967042}

Throughout fetal development and into childhood growth and development,
bone forms on the cartilaginous matrix. By the time a fetus is born,
most of the cartilage has been replaced with bone. Some additional
cartilage will be replaced throughout childhood, and some cartilage
remains in the adult skeleton.

# Intramembranous Ossification
{: data-type="title"}

During <span data-type="term">intramembranous ossification</span>,
compact and spongy bone develops directly from sheets of mesenchymal
(undifferentiated) connective tissue. The flat bones of the face, most
of the cranial bones, and the clavicles (collarbones) are formed via
intramembranous ossification.
{: #fs-id1804592}

The process begins when mesenchymal cells in the embryonic skeleton
gather together and begin to differentiate into specialized cells
([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_04_01){: .autogenerated-content}**a**{:
data-effect="bold"}). Some of these cells will differentiate into
capillaries, while others will become osteogenic cells and then
osteoblasts. Although they will ultimately be spread out by the
formation of bone tissue, early osteoblasts appear in a cluster called
an <span data-type="term">ossification center</span>.
{: #fs-id691904}

The osteoblasts secrete <span data-type="term">osteoid</span>,
uncalcified matrix, which calcifies (hardens) within a few days as
mineral salts are deposited on it, thereby entrapping the osteoblasts
within. Once entrapped, the osteoblasts become osteocytes
([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_04_01){: .autogenerated-content}**b**{:
data-effect="bold"}). As osteoblasts transform into osteocytes,
osteogenic cells in the surrounding connective tissue differentiate into
new osteoblasts.
{: #fs-id919938}

Osteoid (unmineralized bone matrix) secreted around the capillaries
results in a trabecular matrix, while osteoblasts on the surface of the
spongy bone become the periosteum ([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_04_01){:
.autogenerated-content}**c**{: data-effect="bold"}). The periosteum then
creates a protective layer of compact bone superficial to the trabecular
bone. The trabecular bone crowds nearby blood vessels, which eventually
condense into red marrow ([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_04_01){:
.autogenerated-content}**d**{: data-effect="bold"}).

Intramembranous ossification begins *in utero*{: data-effect="italics"}
during fetal development and continues on into adolescence. At birth,
the skull and clavicles are not fully ossified nor are the sutures of
the skull closed. This allows the skull and shoulders to deform during
passage through the birth canal. The last bones to ossify via
intramembranous ossification are the flat bones of the face, which reach
their adult size at the end of the adolescent growth spurt.

# Endochondral Ossification
{: data-type="title"}

In <span data-type="term">endochondral ossification</span>, bone
develops by *replacing*{: data-effect="italics"} hyaline cartilage.
Cartilage does not become bone. Instead, cartilage serves as a template
to be completely replaced by new bone. Endochondral ossification takes
much longer than intramembranous ossification. Bones at the base of the
skull and long bones form via endochondral ossification.
{: #fs-id1966864}

In a long bone, for example, at about 6 to 8 weeks after conception,
some of the mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes (cartilage
cells) that form the cartilaginous skeletal precursor of the bones
([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_04_02){: .autogenerated-content}**a**{:

As more matrix is produced, the chondrocytes in the center of the
cartilaginous model grow in size. As the matrix calcifies, nutrients can
no longer reach the chondrocytes. This results in their death and the
disintegration of the surrounding cartilage. Blood vessels invade the
resulting spaces, not only enlarging the cavities but also carrying
osteogenic cells with them, many of which will become osteoblasts. These
enlarging spaces eventually combine to become the medullary cavity.
{: #fs-id1522787}

As the cartilage grows, capillaries penetrate it. This penetration
initiates the transformation of the perichondrium into the
bone-producing periosteum. Here, the osteoblasts form a periosteal
collar of compact bone around the cartilage of the diaphysis. By the
second or third month of fetal life, bone cell development and
ossification ramps up and creates the <span data-type="term">primary
ossification center</span>, a region deep in the periosteal collar where
ossification begins ([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_04_02){:
.autogenerated-content}**c**{: data-effect="bold"}).
{: #fs-id1501456}

While these deep changes are occurring, chondrocytes and cartilage
continue to grow at the ends of the bone (the future epiphyses), which
increases the bone’s length at the same time bone is replacing cartilage
in the diaphyses. By the time the fetal skeleton is fully formed,
cartilage only remains at the joint surface as articular cartilage and
between the diaphysis and epiphysis as the epiphyseal plate, the latter
of which is responsible for the longitudinal growth of bones. After
birth, this same sequence of events (matrix mineralization, death of
chondrocytes, invasion of blood vessels from the periosteum, and seeding
with osteogenic cells that become osteoblasts) occurs in the epiphyseal
regions, and each of these centers of activity is referred to as a <span

# How Bones Grow in Length
{: data-type="title"}

The epiphyseal plate is the area of growth in a long bone. It is a layer
of hyaline cartilage where ossification occurs in immature bones. On the
epiphyseal side of the epiphyseal plate, cartilage is formed. On the
diaphyseal side, cartilage is ossified, and the diaphysis grows in
length. The epiphyseal plate is composed of four zones of cells and
activity ([\[link\]](#fig-ch06_04_03){: .autogenerated-content}). The
<span data-type="term">reserve zone</span> is the region closest to the
epiphyseal end of the plate and contains small chondrocytes within the
matrix. These chondrocytes do not participate in bone growth but secure
the epiphyseal plate to the osseous tissue of the epiphysis.

layer, the <span data-type="term">zone of maturation and

zone. The more mature cells are situated closer to the diaphyseal end of
the plate. The longitudinal growth of bone is a result of cellular
division in the proliferative zone and the maturation of cells in the
zone of maturation and hypertrophy.

Most of the chondrocytes in the <span data-type="term">zone of calcified

matrix around them has calcified. Capillaries and osteoblasts from the

connects the epiphyseal plate to the diaphysis. A bone grows in length
when osseous tissue is added to the diaphysis.

Bones continue to grow in length until early adulthood. The rate of
growth is controlled by hormones, which will be discussed later. When

# How Bones Grow in Diameter
{: data-type="title"}

While bones are increasing in length, they are also increasing in
diameter; growth in diameter can continue even after longitudinal growth
ceases. This is called appositional growth. Osteoclasts resorb old bone
that lines the medullary cavity, while osteoblasts, via intramembranous
ossification, produce new bone tissue beneath the periosteum. The
erosion of old bone along the medullary cavity and the deposition of new
bone beneath the periosteum not only increase the diameter of the
diaphysis but also increase the diameter of the medullary cavity. This
process is called <span data-type="term">modeling</span>.

# Bone Remodeling
{: data-type="title"}

The process in which matrix is resorbed on one surface of a bone and
deposited on another is known as bone modeling. Modeling primarily takes
place during a bone’s growth. However, in adult life, bone undergoes
<span data-type="term">remodeling</span>, in which resorption of old or
damaged bone takes place on the same surface where osteoblasts lay new
bone to replace that which is resorbed. Injury, exercise, and other
activities lead to remodeling. Those influences are discussed later in
the chapter, but even without injury or exercise, about 5 to 10 percent
of the skeleton is remodeled annually just by destroying old bone and
renewing it with fresh bone.

Diseases of the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Skeletal System</span> Osteogenesis imperfecta
(OI) is a genetic disease in which bones do not form properly and
therefore are fragile and break easily. It is also called brittle bone
disease. The disease is present from birth and affects a person
throughout life.
{: #fs-id1531263}

The genetic mutation that causes OI affects the body’s production of
collagen, one of the critical components of bone matrix. The severity of
the disease can range from mild to severe. Those with the most severe
forms of the disease sustain many more fractures than those with a mild
form. Frequent and multiple fractures typically lead to bone deformities
and short stature. Bowing of the long bones and curvature of the spine
are also common in people afflicted with OI. Curvature of the spine
makes breathing difficult because the lungs are compressed.
{: #fs-id1805522}

Because collagen is such an important structural protein in many parts
of the body, people with OI may also experience fragile skin, weak
muscles, loose joints, easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, brittle
teeth, blue sclera, and hearing loss. There is no known cure for OI.
Treatment focuses on helping the person retain as much independence as
possible while minimizing fractures and maximizing mobility. Toward that
end, safe exercises, like swimming, in which the body is less likely to
experience collisions or compressive forces, are recommended. Braces to
support legs, ankles, knees, and wrists are used as needed. Canes,
walkers, or wheelchairs can also help compensate for weaknesses.
{: #fs-id2040568}

When bones do break, casts, splints, or wraps are used. In some cases,
metal rods may be surgically implanted into the long bones of the arms
and legs. Research is currently being conducted on using bisphosphonates
to treat OI. Smoking and being overweight are especially risky in people
with OI, since smoking is known to weaken bones, and extra body weight
puts additional stress on the bones.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

All bone formation is a replacement process. Embryos develop a
cartilaginous skeleton and various membranes. During development, these
are replaced by bone during the ossification process. In intramembranous
ossification, bone develops directly from sheets of mesenchymal
connective tissue. In endochondral ossification, bone develops by
replacing hyaline cartilage. Activity in the epiphyseal plate enables
bones to grow in length. Modeling allows bones to grow in diameter.
Remodeling occurs as bone is resorbed and replaced by new bone.
Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disease in which collagen
production is altered, resulting in fragile, brittle bones.

    medullary cavity.
3.  They grow and form the periosteum.
4.  They group together to form the primary ossification center.

In what ways do intramembranous and endochondral ossification differ?
{: #fs-id1667508}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id773665" data-label="" markdown="1">
In intramembranous ossification, bone develops directly from sheets of
mesenchymal connective tissue, but in endochondral ossification, bone
develops by replacing hyaline cartilage. Intramembranous ossification is
complete by the end of the adolescent growth spurt, while endochondral
ossification lasts into young adulthood. The flat bones of the face,
most of the cranial bones, and a good deal of the clavicles
(collarbones) are formed via intramembranous ossification, while bones
at the base of the skull and the long bones form via endochondral
ossification.

Considering how a long bone develops, what are the similarities and
differences between a primary and a secondary ossification center?
{: #fs-id1059378}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1517050" data-label="" markdown="1">
A single primary ossification center is present, during endochondral
ossification, deep in the periosteal collar. Like the primary
ossification center, secondary ossification centers are present during
endochondral ossification, but they form later, and there are two of
them, one in each epiphysis.
