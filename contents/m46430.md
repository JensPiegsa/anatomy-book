The urinary system has roles you may be well aware of: cleansing the
blood and ridding the body of wastes probably come to mind. However,
there are additional, equally important functions played by the system.
Take for example, regulation of pH, a function shared with the lungs and
the buffers in the blood. Additionally, the regulation of blood pressure
is a role shared with the heart and blood vessels. What about regulating
the concentration of solutes in the blood? Did you know that the kidney
is important in determining the concentration of red blood cells?
Eighty-five percent of the erythropoietin (EPO) produced to stimulate
red blood cell production is produced in the kidneys. The kidneys also
perform the final synthesis step of vitamin D production, converting
calcidiol to calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D.

If the kidneys fail, these functions are compromised or lost altogether,
with devastating effects on homeostasis. The affected individual might
experience weakness, lethargy, shortness of breath, anemia, widespread
edema (swelling), metabolic acidosis, rising potassium levels, heart
arrhythmias, and more. Each of these functions is vital to your
well-being and survival. The urinary system, controlled by the nervous
system, also stores urine until a convenient time for disposal and then
provides the anatomical structures to transport this waste liquid to the
outside of the body. Failure of nervous control or the anatomical
structures leading to a loss of control of urination results in a
condition called incontinence.

This chapter will help you to understand the anatomy of the urinary
system and how it enables the physiologic functions critical to
homeostasis. It is best to think of the kidney as a regulator of plasma
makeup rather than simply a urine producer. As you read each section,
ask yourself this question: “What happens if this does not work?” This
question will help you to understand how the urinary system maintains
homeostasis and affects all the other systems of the body and the
quality of one’s life.
